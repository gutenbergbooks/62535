takes you back to the dawn of history, long before the Pyramids of Egypt were built; down
through the romantic, troubled times of Chaldea&#8217;s grandeur and Assyria&#8217;s magnificence; of Babylonia&#8217;s
wealth and luxury; of Greek and Roman splendor; of Mohammedan culture and refinement; of French elegance
and British power; to the rise of the Western world, including the complete history of the United States and
all other nations down to the close of the Russia-Japan war.</p>

<p class="bodytext blankbefore25"><span class="largeridpath"><b><span class="large_r">R</span>idpath&#8217;s</b></span>
enviable position as an historian is due to his wonderfully beautiful style, a style no other historian
has ever equaled. He pictures the great historical events as though they were happening before
your eyes; he carries you with him to see the battles of old; to meet kings and queens and warriors;
to sit in the Roman Senate; to march against Saladin and his dark-skinned followers; to sail the southern
seas with Drake; to circumnavigate the globe with Magellan; to watch that this line of Greek spearmen
work havoc with the Persian hordes on the field of Marathon; to know Napoleon as you know
Roosevelt. He combines absorbing interest with supreme reliability, and makes the heroes of history
real living men and women, and about them he weaves the rise and fall of empires in such
a fascinating style that history becomes as absorbingly interesting as the greatest of fiction.</p>

<p class="bodytext blankbefore25"><span class="largeridpath"><b><span class="large_r">R</span>idpath&#8217;s</b></span>
History is strongly endorsed by Presidents Harrison, Cleveland, and
McKinley, Jefferson Davis, Lew Wallace, John L. Stoddard, Bishop Vincent,
Dr. Cuyler, Rabbi Hirsch, Presidents of Ann Harbor, Amherst, Brown,
Dartmouth, Tufts, Trinity, Bates, Colby, Smith, Vassar, Yale, and other
Colleges, and by the Great American People, 200,000 of whom own and love it.</p>

not manipulated by speculators or stock jobbers. It is offered
now at a very low price, for rapid development purposes,
and will sell at par soon, we believe, going higher as the
mine develops. If you want to make money rapidly we
advise you to purchase and hold this stock for large and
regularly paid dividends. The stock of one Nevada Gold
Mine increased 50 per cent in one day; 18 Nevada stocks
during October 1906 increased in value Twenty-One Million

a financial success if you as our clientele only patronize
them to that extent whereby they can carry their advertisement

the character of the advertisements which we carry, which
necessarily restricts our revenue from this source, so in your

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Watson&#8217;s Jeffersonian Magazine</span> stands for all that is
best in the life of the people and the future of the republic.
It will advocate those principles for which its editor has so
long fought. It is Mr. Watson&#8217;s unselfish ambition to establish
this Magazine in the minds, hearts and thoughts of our
people; to make it a power for the right against the wrong and
to make it a factor in moulding the minds of our young manhood
and womanhood for the future.</p>

<p class="center blankbefore75 blankafter75"><i>OUR REQUEST.</i></p>

<p>If you believe in the principles which this Magazine represents.
If you would see it succeed, First, read it, every department.
Then talk <span class="smcap">Watson&#8217;s Jeffersonian Magazine</span> enthusiastically
with every one with whom you come in contact, make
up your mind to send at least five (5) yearly subscriptions
before our next issue is out, and send them. You will find
this an easy task if you will make it a point to call on those
whom you know to believe in justice and freedom.</p>

<p>It is impossible to portray in words our appreciation to
the many hundreds who have more than granted this request
already. We can only predict greater results from them in
the near future, which bespeaks our absolute confidence in their
unselfish devotion to a cause which has had more than one
martyr.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<div class="requesttext">

<p class="noindent blankbefore75"><b>Gentlemen:</b></p>

<p>By as foul a deal as was ever made, &#8220;Watson&#8217;s Magazine,&#8221; of
New York, has been taken out of my hands.</p>

<p>The written Contract, upon which I relied, has been shamelessly
set aside.</p>

<p>A man whom I selected as my personal representative, and
placed in the office at a fine salary, <b>which has always been paid</b>,
betrayed me.</p>

<p>He and Col. Mann formed a new company, seized the Magazine
under legal forms, and are now running it for themselves.</p>

<p><b>Col. Mann of Town Topics is Editor-in-Chief.</b></p>

<p>C. Q. DeFrance is Associate Editor and Business Manager.</p>

<p>They have flooded the country with <b>a lying circular letter</b>,
intended to deceive the people as to the cause of my withdrawal.</p>

<p><b>Col. Mann&#8217;s name is not even mentioned in this circular.</b></p>

<p>Almost every statement made about me in that circular is a
base, malicious falsehood. They are simply <b>trying to hide their
own guilt in a cloud of slanderous fabrications</b>.</p>

<p>In the November number of &#8220;Watson&#8217;s Magazine&#8221; appeared
an article with the title of &#8220;<b>Explanatory</b>.&#8221; It should have been
labelled &#8220;<b>Defamatory</b>.&#8221;</p>

<p>It reeks with venom and lies. <b>Col. Mann wrote part of it</b>,
and DeFrance wrote the balance.</p>

<p>These publications of theirs do me the rankest injustice.</p>

<p><b>I have no mailing list of the magazine which bears my name, and
never had one.</b></p>

<p><b>Consequently, I am at present powerless to reach the subscribers
and readers of &#8220;Watson&#8217;s Magazine.&#8221; I have no way of letting
them know the real state of the case.</b></p>

<p><b>On account of this very serious disadvantage, I make this appeal
to you:</b></p>

<p><b>Pray, inform your readers that I am now publishing the genuine
Watson&#8217;s Jeffersonian Magazine in Atlanta, Ga., of which this is the
first number.</b></p>

<p>And that in the &#8220;Foreword&#8221; of this number is given <b>a full
history of my connection with the New York Magazine, together
with my reasons for quitting.</b></p>

<p>In the interest of <b>Fair Play</b>, I beg that you do me this favor.</p>

<p>It is one which, under similar circumstances <b>you would not
ask of me in vain</b>.</p>

<h2>Foreword.</h2>

<div class="centerblock">
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Watson&#8217;s Magazine</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The familiar emblem, the Liberty Bell, is in the

<span class="padl6">121 West 42nd Street, New York.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Opening this Thing and scanning the Table of Contents, I note the
absence of the name of Mr. Watson, former Editor-in-Chief.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s out.</p>

<p>Nor do I see the name of the former Managing Editor, Mr. Duffy.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s out, also.</p>

<p>C. Q. DeFrance is still on deck, however, and Ted Flaacke is still
Advertising Manager&mdash;with no advertisements to manage.</p>

<p>Then comes a statement of the Contents of the November number.
First the old familiar word, &#8220;<span class="smcap">Editorials</span>,&#8221; meets my eyes. But the name
of the writer is not given.</p>

<p>It used to be Mr. Watson. <span class="smcap">Who is it now?</span></p>

<p>The Table of Contents does not state.</p>

<p>The Editor is a Man of Mystery. Was he ashamed of his Editorials,
or were the Editorials ashamed of <i>him</i>? Deponent sayeth not&mdash;because
he doesn&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>Everybody else&#8217;s name is given, save that of the only man whose
name there was any special reason for giving&mdash;to wit, <span class="smcap">The Editor</span>.</p>

<p>Is <span class="smcapall">THIS</span> the way they send you into the world, <span class="smcapall">MY CHILD</span>? Offspring
of my hand, my heart and my soul&mdash;Benjamin of my old age! Is <span class="smcapall">THIS</span>

<p>Glancing down the list of writers who have contributed to this
November number, I am startled to find the name of Thos. E. Watson.</p>

<p>Who is <i>he</i>, anyhow? Isn&#8217;t he the man whom Colonel Mann and
DeFrance have been slandering through the newspapers? Why put <i>his</i>
name into <i>this</i> pot?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page4">[4]</span></p>

<p>Curious to see what Mr. Watson may have written for the Thing,
I follow the page reference (103) and find the familiar headline &#8220;<span class="smcap">Educational
Department</span>.&#8221; This department was my own creation, primarily
intended for the instruction of the younger members of the family. Under
the headline of &#8220;Educational Department,&#8221; the Thing puts a list of
books.</p>

<p>Some boy wrote to me last winter asking me to name one hundred
books which would be useful to the general reader. I made out the list,
last February, and mailed it to New York.</p>

<p>In their quandary of dismissing Watson, the man, and holding
on to Watson, the Reputation, <i>they fished that list of books out of the
waste-basket</i> and published it. <i>They</i> signed my name to it.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the only item in the Thing&#8217;s &#8220;Educational Department.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pitiful!</p>

<p>At the very time when they are slandering me in the newspapers,
and denying to me any share in the Magazine which my unpaid labor
built up, Mann and DeFrance have the cynical indecency to continue to
use my name as a writer for <i>their</i> magazine.</p>

<p>Turning to &#8220;<span class="smcap">Letters From the People</span>,&#8221; a Department which owes
its creation to me, I find letters praising &#8220;Watson&#8217;s Magazine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dates are not given. These would have disclosed the fact that
the letters were written before the severance of my connection with the
Magazine. The writers were <i>my friends</i>, and by their letters <i>they had
meant to encourage me in my work</i>.</p>

<p>The cover of the Magazine bears the name</p>

<p class="center highline4">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Watson&#8217;s Magazine Company</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two individuals who compose this &#8220;Company&#8221; are Col. W. D.
Mann and C. Q. DeFrance&mdash;a very precious &#8220;Company.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of my Magazine, Mann took half, and DeFrance took half.</p>

<p>By what right?</p>

<p>Concede that Col. Mann was entitled to grab half of the Magazine
because of the money which he had lost through the stupid mismanagement
of the Business Department&mdash;where did DeFrance get <i>his</i> right to
<i>the other half</i>? <span class="smcap">He has never done a lick of work for the Magazine
that wasn&#8217;t paid for at full price.</span></p>

<p>Where, then, was <span class="smcapall">HIS</span> right to seize, under legal form, one half of the
Magazine?</p>

<p>I called him from a very modest position in Nebraska, and put him
in the office as my personal and political representative. Starting him
at $40 per week, I soon advanced him to $60 per week&mdash;a higher salary
than he had ever been paid, by far. I trusted him, implicitly. To the
last moment, I relied upon him, absolutely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page5">[5]</span></p>

<p><i>And he betrayed me.</i> Often have I, like other men, experienced
ingratitude; sometimes perfidy&mdash;but never have I been stung by such
venomous and unexpected treachery as that of DeFrance.</p>

<p>Let it pass.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>There is another deceptive inscription upon the cover of the November
number of the spurious &#8220;Watson&#8217;s Magazine.&#8221; It is the address,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">121 West 42 Street.</span></p>

<p>That is <span class="smcapall">NOT</span> the true address which should be used now. Colonel
Mann has taken the spurious &#8220;Watson&#8217;s&#8221; into the quarters of his <span class="smcap">Town

of <span class="smcap">Smart Set</span>. And a <i>mighty</i> smart set it is, too.</p>

<p>Last March the blustering old scamp who rolls around beneath the

Magazine&#8221; from 42nd Street over to the Smart Set den.</p>

<p>I declined to let him do it. At that time, DeFrance was still true
to me, and he took the same view of the matter. So anxious was he not
to get mired up in Town Topics mud that he telegraphed me to stand
out against Col. Mann and <i>not</i> allow him to make the removal.</p>

<p>Tray, <i>the faithful</i>, wanted to keep out of bad company. Tray, the

<p>The first article in the November number of the spurious &#8220;Watson&#8217;s&#8221;
is entitled &#8220;<span class="smcap">Explanatory</span>.&#8221; Most of it had already appeared in Colonel
Mann&#8217;s <span class="smcap">Town Topics</span>. The rest of it bears the earmark of DeFrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Explanatory</span>&#8221; was prepared by <span class="smcap">the present Editors</span> of the New
York &#8220;Watson&#8217;s Magazine&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Col. Mann and DeFrance</span>. Well aware
of the fact that the Public would not patronize <i>a Reform magazine</i> edited
by such a creature as himself, Col. Mann has rushed into the newspapers
with a declaration <i>that he never saw or heard of</i> &#8220;<span class="smcap">Explanatory</span>&#8221; <i>until
after its appearance in the November &#8220;Watson&#8217;s.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>What a shameless falsehood!</p>

<p>Col. Mann and DeFrance fixed up that &#8220;<span class="smcap">Explanatory</span>&#8221; mess, and
<i>Mr. Gordon Nye, the artist, was commissioned to take the &#8220;Proofs&#8221; to

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Nye</span>, who is now living with me, <span class="smcap">assures me that he carried
these &#8220;Proofs&#8221; to Col. Mann&#8217;s house on 72nd Street, that Col.
Mann read and corrected the &#8220;Proofs,&#8221; and that he made certain
alterations in the article</span>.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Nye took the Proofs of &#8220;<span class="smcap">Explanatory</span>&#8221; <i>back to DeFrance</i>,
and delivered to that person <i>the orders of</i> <span class="smcap">the real Editor-in-Chief</span> of
the New York &#8220;Watson&#8217;s Magazine.&#8221;</p>

<p>For <span class="smcap">the real Editor-in-Chief</span> of the bogus &#8220;Watson&#8217;s Magazine&#8221;
<span class="smcap">is Col. Mann, Editor of Town Topics and Smart Set</span>.</p>

<p>Nice Editor-in-Chief <i>for a reform magazine</i>, isn&#8217;t he?</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>I am going to give, once for all, a simple statement of the whole
transaction, and then I will try to forget it, in higher, nobler work.
Nothing is a more thankless task than the narration of the events leading
to such a climax as this.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>After the national election of 1904, I went to New York to hold a
conference with our National Chairman, Mr. Ferriss, and with other men<span class="pagenum" id="Page7">[7]</span>
who had been prominently identified with our side of the campaign. The
conference was held at the office of Mr. Palliser who had been acting
manager of the campaign in New York. I also wished to confer with
Mr. Brisbane, who had long been urging me to join him in editing the
Hearst papers. He had repeatedly written and telegraphed. A definite
offer of $10,000 to edit Mr. Hearst&#8217;s morning paper, the American, had
been made. If I had been ready to accept a thousand dollars per month,
there is no doubt that it would have been paid. But while I was powerfully
inclined to cooperate with Brisbane, I did not like to be swallowed
up in Hearst. Besides, to edit a daily paper necessitated my residence in
New York, whereas my interests, as well as local attachments, were too
great to make the removal one to which I could readily gain my own
consent.</p>

<p>While in this uncertain state of mind, Colonel Mann burst in upon
me, at my hotel, in all the glory and pomposity of white whiskers, white
hair, wine-colored face, spotted waistcoat, gold-headed cane, baywindow
belly, eyes that looked like hard boiled eggs, and a voice thick with high-living
and constant use.</p>

<p>As I may have remarked before, he looked just like a picture taken
out of a child&#8217;s colored picture book.</p>

<p>While he talked to me, I sat there trying to make up my mind as
to which he resembled most, an idealized portrayal of Santa Claus, or of
John Bull, or of John Barlycorn. I finally decided that he would do for
a composite photograph of all three.</p>

<p>This funny looking old chap I had never heard of before. His Town
Topics I had never seen&mdash;didn&#8217;t know of its existence.</p>

<p>He introduced the purpose of his visit by saying that he had heard
of Mr. Hearst&#8217;s proposition to me. If I had committed myself to Mr.
Hearst, he had no more to say; otherwise he had a proposition to submit.
Told that I was free, he outlined his project.</p>

<p>He would finance a great national magazine, if I would edit the same.</p>

<p>Casually and lightly, he mentioned $100,000 as the amount he would
risk on the venture.</p>

<p>With that amount he had made <i>Smart Set</i> &#8220;go,&#8221; and he did not
doubt that a like amount would make another magazine &#8220;go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everything must be in my name&mdash;corporation, magazine, signboard,
tail-piece and all. Not being particularly ashamed of my name, I had
no objection to this.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as I belonged to a political party which had just demonstrated
to its own satisfaction that it was the most unpopular political
conglomeration on the face of the earth, I imagined that such a fine
looking old personage as Col. Mann&mdash;calling himself a Democrat&mdash;was
afraid he would deface his own reputation by associating with a political<span class="pagenum" id="Page8">[8]</span>
outcast, like me, and that, therefore, while willing to pocket all the money
the magazine might earn, he didn&#8217;t want his name to appear.</p>

<p>Considerate old buck, he wouldn&#8217;t hurt my feelings by using the
plebeian word &#8220;salary.&#8221; The word &#8220;compensation&#8221; was likewise too
vulgar to be applied to my monthly and yearly stipend. With a rich
roll in his deep bass voice, he mentioned the &#8220;<i>honorarium</i>&#8221; which I was
to receive for my work. My &#8220;<i>honorarium</i>&#8221; was to be $500 per month.
Besides, my traveling expenses to and from New York were to be paid.</p>

<p>He emphasized the fact that, under his proposition, I would not have
to live in New York. A monthly visit was contemplated, but never made
compulsory, save upon the summons of the Board of Directors.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600">
<img src="images/illo008.jpg" alt="Cartoon" width="600" height="513" />
<p class="caption">EVEN IF THEY COULD BEND THE BOW, THEY HAVE NOT THE ARROWS.</p>
</div>

<p>For several reasons, Col. Mann&#8217;s proposition impressed me favorably.
First, it preserved my identity. Second, it left me free to say just what
I pleased. Third, it did not take me away from my home&mdash;to which I am
tenderly attached. My ancestors helped to clear the primeval forest off<span class="pagenum" id="Page9">[9]</span>
these old red hills of Georgia, and I love them, as I could love no other
land under the sun.</p>

<p>For these several reasons, I practically decided, then and there, to
accept Col. Mann&#8217;s proposition. He saw this&mdash;being a shrewd old fellow&mdash;and
did his utmost to get me to his office, in order that the contract
might be drawn up and signed before I left New York.</p>

<p>But I was not <i>quite</i> so much of a greenhorn as all that. I refused to
close the deal, then, but asked him to send his proposition, in writing,
to me in Georgia.</p>

<p>Returning home, I fell sick. Overwork, mental strain, sleeplessness,
worry, etc., stretched me out. Unable to return to New York after Col.
Mann had mailed me the proposed contract, I decided to place myself
in the hands of a friend.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>Dr. John H. Girdner, a native of Greenville, Tenn., had been one
of my most prominent and active supporters in New York during the
campaign of 1904. Previously he had been widely known as the political
lieutenant and confidential friend of Mr. Bryan. Previous to that, he was
well known as the family physician and political follower of Mr.
Cleveland.</p>

<p>Having long been a resident of New York, Dr. Girdner seemed to
me the ideal man to represent me in the negotiations with Col. Mann.</p>

<p>The Doctor accepted the trust, and finally sent me the contract for
signature. Some alterations in it had been made. One of these, and
the most important, was the creation of the office of Associate Editor,
at a salary of &#8220;<i>not exceeding</i>&#8221; $4,000 per year. This office was to be
personal to me. That is, I could make and unmake Associate Editors at
will, <i>provided</i> Col. Mann did not have to pay them <i>more</i> than $4,000
per year.</p>

<p>In communicating this feature of the contract to me, Dr. Girdner
signified his willingness to fill that position. It gave me great pleasure to
appoint him. Nothing was ever said by the Doctor or myself concerning
the amount that he was to receive, but he assumed, quite correctly, that it
would be proper for him to draw the full $4,000, and he began to do so.</p>

<p>Not once did Dr. Girdner intimate to me that a business connection
with Col. Mann would disgrace me. How could I suppose that such a
connection was undesirable when Dr. Girdner himself was willing to
make it? I am sure that the Doctor did not know what all the world
now knows.</p>

<p>It cost the Colliers $75,000 and months of hard work, to gather up
the evidence which proved what kind of a person Col. Mann is. How
could Dr. Girdner know, <span class="smcapall">IN</span> 1904, those facts which it cost Collier $75,000
to prove <span class="smcapall">IN</span> 1905? The Doctor knew no more about it than I did&mdash;or he
would have warned me to keep out, and would have kept out himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page10">[10]</span></p>

<p>When I went to New York in the mid-winter of 1904-5 to organize
the Company, Col. Mann opened another leaf in his book.</p>

<p>He presented a paper containing stock subscriptions to his Syndicate,
and asked me to &#8220;come in.&#8221; I was fool enough to sign for $2,500.</p>

<p>Had the old scamp not over-reached himself, he would have got me
for $2,500, <i>besides the $9,000 hereinafter mentioned</i>. But he <i>did overreach</i>
himself. He had his man, Daniels, to present <i>another paper</i> for
me to sign. It was the lease of the house we were to occupy, 121 West
42nd Street. The amount was $1,200.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Then</span>, I smelt the rat. I not only refused to sign the
lease, but, acting under a natural revulsion of feeling, I cancelled
my subscription to the Syndicate. Had Col. Mann said a single word
against my doing so, <i>I would have cancelled the whole contract</i>&mdash;for the
suspicion had then crept into my mind that he was&mdash;what I now know
him to be&mdash;<span class="smcapall">A GRAND OLD RASCAL</span>.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>Why, then, did I go on with the Magazine?</p>

<p>Because I was fastened. Because I had publicly pledged my word.
Because the contract gave me complete control of the Magazine, therefore
Col. Mann could not hurt it. Me he <i>could</i> hurt; me he <i>did</i> hurt, but
the <span class="smcap">Magazine was, is now, and ever shall be, above and beyond his
reach</span>. Thank God!</p>

<p>The soul of the Magazine was the breath of life which Jehovah
breathed into <i>me</i>; and Col. Mann can no more defile it by his touch than
he can defile me.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>I commenced working industriously for the Magazine in December
1904. Hundreds of letters were mailed from my house every month.
Hundreds of subscribers enrolled themselves and paid their money in
advance of the publication. I paid my own assistants, paid the postage,
worked for nothing. <i>It wasn&#8217;t the money that I was after.</i> Col. Mann
saw that, <i>and took every advantage of it</i>.</p>

<p>Not a cent of the small sum that was paid me came out of <i>his</i> pocket.
I am glad to be able to say so.</p>

<p>But while money-making was not my purpose, I could not contemplate
with any satisfaction the prospect of <i>never</i> being able to get
anything for my labor. The Magazine was bearing upon me heavily.
The contract only asked 3,000 words per month of me. After the first
few numbers, my task was never less than about 20,000 words</p>

<p>All this work I did with my own hand. Mr. Duffy, the Managing
Editor, had a stenographer. Mr. Flaacke, Advertising Manager, had a
stenographer; Mr. DeFrance, Business Manager, had a stenographer. I
am not sure about Mr. Hoffman and the office boy, Robert, but I guess<span class="pagenum" id="Page11">[11]</span>
they had one too. <i>The Editor-in-Chief was the only member of the staff
who had to do his own work.</i></p>

<p>Finally, the toil became so irksome&mdash;especially during the Georgia
campaign of 1906, when Everybody and his Uncle and his Aunt were
jumping on me&mdash;that <i>I begged DeFrance to allow me six dollars per week
for a stenographer</i>. He did so for several weeks and then quit. In ceasing
to help me to this pitiful extent, he gave me neither excuse nor explanation.</p>

<p>He himself was all the while drawing his $60 per week, for dictating
to a fifteen-dollar-per-week stenographer.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Explanatory</span>&#8221; alleges that I usurped authority, and began to discharge
employes as though the Magazine were my personal property.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Explanatory</span>&#8221; says that, unfortunately, I was allowed to have my
way in a great many business matters.</p>

<p>The new Editors, Mann and DeFrance, give <i>no specifications</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I will give some.</span></p>

<p>Into <i>the very first number of the Magazine</i>, Col. Mann inserted a full
page <i>advertisement of some of his nasty</i> &#8220;<span class="smcap">Smart Set</span>&#8221; <i>books</i>. When I
saw that advertisement, which <i>had been slipped into the magazine without
my knowledge</i>, Ted Flaacke, Advertising Manager, was summoned to
my room, and <i>told that there wasn&#8217;t money enough in New York to buy
space in my Magazine for prurient literature of that sort</i>.</p>

<p>I peremptorily demanded that the filthy thing be kept out, and <i>it
was kept out</i>. It is due Mr. Flaacke to say, that <i>he, himself, had known
nothing of the ad. until the magazine was out</i>.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of Col. Mann&#8217;s displeasure. He realized
that he could <i>never make a tool of me</i>&mdash;as he is now making of DeFrance.</p>

<p>The <i>Titles</i> of some of those books are as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;An Eclipse of Virtue,&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret&#8217;s Misadventure,&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naughty Elizabeth,&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sweet Sin,&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Ashes of Desire,&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An Unspeakable Siren,&#8221; etc., etc.</p>

<p>Now, it may be that these books are not so bad as their names would
indicate&mdash;I have never read them&mdash;<i>but Col. Mann meant</i> by these titles,
<i>to cater to the diseased taste for erotic literature</i>. Hence <span class="smcapall">HE SLIPPED THE
AD. IN</span>, without notice to me or to Ted Flaacke. <span class="smcap">That ad., in our very
first number, hurt the magazine seriously.</span> I felt that Col. Mann had
no right to degrade the Magazine by making it a distributor of vile books,
hence my positive instructions to Mr. Flaacke. In justice to this gentleman,
I should say that he agreed with me fully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page12">[12]</span></p>

<p>Again: Col. Mann placed the Business Management in the hands
of a young coal-dealer who knew nothing whatever about Circulation
Management, nor about Business Management of that kind. He was a
most amiable young gentleman and perfectly honest. I liked him personally,
very much. But, unfortunately, he was addicted to the use of
intoxicating liquors&mdash;even during business hours&mdash;and frequently
attempted to perform the duties when too much inebriated to do so. Dr.
Girdner first called my attention to this, and then DeFrance. Our
business affairs soon suffered so much from the young man&#8217;s infirmity,
that both Dr. Girdner and DeFrance suggested that we make a change.
I took the matter up with Col. Mann, <i>who had himself began to find fault
with the young man</i>, and the result was that he was requested to resign.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600">
<img src="images/illo012.jpg" alt="Cartoon" width="600" height="574" />
<p class="caption">CROCKETT MANN AND THE SOCIETY COONS.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page13">[13]</span></p>

<p>DeFrance had wanted the young man&#8217;s place, and he got it, <i>with
an increase of salary</i>. It was at my instance that DeFrance was thus
advanced.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>Every change made by me was made in the interest of economy, and
resulted in benefit.</p>

<p>I wanted to make other changes, for the same reason.</p>

<p>We paid Mr. Flaacke in salary and expense account, about $5,000
per year, and never got advertising enough to pay the bill. I wanted
to stop that nonsense, and to put Mr. Flaacke on the commission basis.</p>

<p><i>I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if Col. Mann has, himself, now made that very
change.</i></p>

<p>The Managing Editor was getting $50 per week for doing work
which his assistant, Mr. Hoffman, could, as I thought, do as well. I
wanted to put the work on Mr. Hoffman, and save the larger salary.</p>

<p><i>I note with interest that Col. Mann has, himself, made that very
change.</i></p>

<p>Thus <span class="smcapall">THEY, THEMSELVES, VINDICATE ME</span>, unintentionally, from the
accusations they make.</p>

<p><i>Col. Mann approved every change I made while I was in charge, and
he now makes the other changes for which I contended.</i></p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>When Edgerton went out, it had been demonstrated that the Magazine
was not going to &#8220;boom&#8221; as Colonel Mann had expected, and that
<i>economy</i> would be the law of its life.</p>

<p>Seeing that two offices could be combined, at a saving of $45 per
week, I made the change, <i>after full consultation with Col. Mann at Col.
Mann&#8217;s house</i>.</p>

<p>As to Dr. Girdner, Col. Mann had kicked at that from the beginning.</p>

<p>From what others told me, I know that Col. Mann vigorously objected
to Dr. Girdner as Associate Editor.</p>

<p>I know that from time to time Col. Mann would inquire, &#8220;<i>Does
Watson still want that fellow Girdner?</i>&#8221; I myself heard Col. Mann
find fault with the Doctor for putting two signed articles in one number
of the Magazine.</p>

<p>And <span class="smcap">I myself heard Col. Mann say</span>, to me and others, in his own
office, &#8220;<i>I don&#8217;t believe Dr. Girdner could ever write a good article.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>When Col. Mann asked me whether Dr. Girdner were <span class="smcapall">INDISPENSABLE
TO ME</span>, I frankly and truthfully said that he was not. <span class="smcap">The Colonel
wanted to stop that salary.</span> The Doctor was not willing to let his
&#8220;<i>honorarium</i>&#8221; accumulate on the books. Like a sensible man, he was
insisting upon drawing what was due him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span></p>

<p>This was <span class="smcap">hurting Col. Mann</span>. Hurting him very much. Therefore,
<span class="smcap">after first ascertaining that I would remain in office</span>, he put Girdner
out, himself. As between an Editor who cashed in his &#8220;<i>honorarium</i>,&#8221;
and one that allowed <i>his</i> to accumulate on the books, who could doubt
which the Colonel would prefer?</p>

<p>It was I who <span class="smcap">insisted that Colonel Mann pay Dr. Girdner a sum
which the Doctor naturally claimed as compensation for breach of
contract</span>.</p>

<p>Dr. Girdner himself should know best why he quit us, and the Doctor
has written me a letter in which he says,</p>

<div class="girdnerletter">

<p>&#8220;I resigned the position of associate editor because my salary had
not been paid for several months, and from the methods of the company

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Explanatory</span>&#8221; has much to say about my son.</p>

<p>The facts are these:</p>

<p>My son had been under Dr. Girdner&#8217;s professional treatment. He
soon began to show a marked improvement, and I realized the helpfulness
to my boy of <i>giving him something to do</i>. He was naturally eager to
work with his father. I, therefore, went to the Business Manager and
sought work for my son, just as I would have done for a stranger.</p>

<p>I said, both to Mr. Green and Col. Mann, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know <i>how</i> he will
do, or <i>what</i> he will be worth, but please <i>give him a trial</i>. If he makes
good, pay him what the work is worth. If he does not make good, I will
not expect you to keep him, and you can charge his salary up to me during
the time he will have been here.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s exactly the way it was. My son commenced work, and when
I next went to New York all of them told me&mdash;and were apparently
delighted to tell me&mdash;that he had made good.</p>

<p>From Dr. Girdner down, they all spoke affectionately of him, and
declared that he was one of the steadiest, quietest employes at the office.</p>

<p>As his strength returned, his usefulness increased and I advanced him
to more important and responsible duties than had at first been put upon
him.</p>

<p>To encourage my boy, and bring out what was best in him, I <i>did</i>
advance him from time to time. <span class="smcap">Who will blame me for wanting to
make a man out of my only son?</span></p>

<p>It was my most earnest desire to train my son in journalism, so that
he could take my place when I should have served out my time and
passed away:&mdash;to that purpose I <i>still</i> cling with a resolution that nothing
can break.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span></p>

<p>At the time DeFrance and Col. Mann kicked him out, he was doing
the &#8220;News Record&#8221; and &#8220;The Say of Other Editors.&#8221; He was doing it
well, as the Magazine will show for itself.</p>

<p>He was being paid $40 per week. This was $10 per week <i>less</i> than
Edgerton had received for the same work.</p>

<p>When I gave my son the place, another position which he had filled
acceptably to the Business Manager, at $15 per week, was abolished.
<i>Thus, even at the highest salary ever paid my son, he saved the Company
$25 per week.</i></p>

<p>I am accused of having mistreated Mr. Edgerton. The facts are
these: <i>he was already working in New York</i> when he applied to me for a
job on the Magazine. I personally requested Col. Mann to take him on.
After much hesitation and seeming reluctance, Col. Mann consented.
When reductions of expenses became necessary, Mr. Edgerton&#8217;s <i>weekly
salary</i> was reduced to $40. He told me that he would hold the job <i>until
he could get another</i>. I did not think he could render us very good service
<i>in that state of mind</i>, and I therefore relieved him of duty. <i>He had
already made $1,200 out of the job</i>&mdash;probably <span class="smcapall">THE EASIEST MONEY THAT
HE HAD EVER EARNED</span>.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Explanatory</span>&#8221; says that at a meeting of the Board of Directors in
November 1905, I agreed to contribute $5,000 to a fund of $25,000, and
then broke my word.</p>

<p>The facts are these:</p>

<p>After repeated efforts to get some satisfaction out of Col. Mann, I
was drawn to New York in November 1905 by a most positive written
promise of his to settle with me if I would come to see him.</p>

<p>I went.</p>

<p>At Col. Mann&#8217;s house on 72nd Street, there was a gathering
of the leading stockholders and leading employes. As each reported for
his own department the employes were excused, and they went away.
Mr. Flaacke spoke his piece and departed. Mr. Duffy, ditto. Finally
the assemblage dwindled down to just me and the Colonel.</p>

<p>But, <i>before this</i>, Col. Mann had suggested that we raise some money,
and asked me <span class="smcapall">IF I DID NOT HAVE SOME FRIENDS THAT I COULD PREVAIL ON TO
&#8220;COME IN.&#8221;</span> The suggestion was put out of business immediately. I
was in the trap all right enough, and I <span class="smcapall">DIDN&#8217;T INTEND TO BE USED AS A
BAIT</span>. Then he asked if I would not continue to work for the Magazine
without pay to the amount of $5,000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I answered, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>In that very connection, however, he had stated, again, his intention
to pay me the amount already due, and which he had promised to pay
if I would come to New York.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page17">[17]</span></p>

<p>But to my amazement he had stated it this way:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I will pay it, but not now.</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Every one who was present must remember these words.</p>

<p>I said nothing at all in reply, but after all the others had retired,
<i>I remained behind and I reminded the Colonel courteously, of his pledge</i>
to pay me when I came to New York. I asked that he pay me at least
<span class="smcapall">HALF THE AMOUNT DUE</span>.</p>

<p>He hung his head, for an instant only, and then, raising a
flushed face, told me he would see what he could do, and give me a reply
next day.</p>

<p>He complained of the heavy expense of his recent litigation, alluding
of course to the celebrated Collier-Hapgood Libel Case and the subsequent
prosecution of himself for perjury.</p>

<p>Next day he wrote me a long, sweet, persuasive letter begging me to
<span class="smcap">wait on him until July, 1906</span>, at which time he would most assuredly
pay. It was <i>then</i> that I did what I should have done at first&mdash;consulted
a New York lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. Palliser advised me to make an end of the matter <i>then</i>, and I
should have taken his advice; but I loved my work and my Magazine, and
at the last moment I yielded and let Col. Mann have his own way.</p>

<p>From motives that he is unable to understand or appreciate, <span class="smcap">I would
have continued the unpaid slave of the Magazine, indefinitely, had
not he and DeFrance made the situation intolerable</span>. I felt my
obligations to the subscribers: my pride in the success of the Magazine
which bore my name was deeply involved. This was well known both to
Col. Mann and DeFrance, <i>and they presumed, upon it&mdash;once too often</i>.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>It may be asked why I did not cut loose from <span class="smcap">the Town Topics gang</span>
<i>after</i> the exposures in the Collier-Hapgood Case. Simply because Col.
Mann had nothing on earth to do with what I regarded as the Magazine,
to wit&mdash;its policy, its purpose, its message. <i>That</i> was the life of the
Magazine. <span class="smcap">That</span>, in my eyes, <span class="smcap">was the Magazine</span>.</p>

<p>I did not want to leave the subscribers in the lurch, nor did I want
to abandon a field of labor in which I seemed to be doing a good work.</p>

<p>Every man who has a purpose in life and who loves his work, will
understand me.</p>

<p>Therefore, when Clark Howell and others jumped on me for being
connected with a person who was being denounced throughout the land
as a blackmailer, I put the case on the strongest ground by saying, &#8220;<span class="smcap">I
am the Magazine.</span>&#8221; That was true. DeFrance and Mann <i>were glad
enough to have me check defection</i> from the Magazine by saying it <span class="smcapall">THEN</span>.</p>

<p>In a very short while <i>they will</i> <span class="smcapall">WISH THAT THEY HAD ANOTHER
METHOD, EQUALLY GOOD, OF CHECKING DEFECTION</span>. The subscribers to<span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span>
the magazine that was mine are not going to endorse what Col. Mann has
done, nor remain with a magazine which <span class="smcapall">HE</span> controls&mdash;<i>never in the world</i>.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>If Colonel Mann had not lost his senses, in his haste to grab the
Magazine, name and all, he would have foreseen <i>the utter folly of trying
to run the thing in my name</i> <span class="smcap">after I had gone out</span>. A <i>new</i> Magazine,
under a <i>new</i> name, he could establish at <span class="smcap">less expense than he will
incur in the vain effort to maintain a Watson&#8217;s Magazine without
Watson</span>. A child ought to be able to see that. What possible good will
<i>my name</i> be to him when he himself publishes the statement that <i>I</i> am
out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The name without the man will be a dead weight to the Magazine</span>,
as Col. Mann has, doubtless, begun to find out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page19">[19]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honesty</span>, in <span class="smcapall">THIS</span> case at least, should have been his
<span class="smcapall">POLICY</span>. It would
have paid him better in the long run.</p>

<p>Col. Mann rushed into court, got a judgment against the Magazine
for $60,000; <i>and sold it</i>, at Sheriff&#8217;s sale, <i>to himself</i>.</p>

<p>He actually <i>had the Sheriff to sell my name, and was ass enough to
buy it</i>.</p>

<p>But he didn&#8217;t buy <i>me</i>, along with the name, and he didn&#8217;t buy <i>the
spirit of the Magazine</i> when he bought the desks, the iron-safe and the
trade name.</p>

<p>The most valuable asset, he could not, and <i>cannot</i> reach.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the Good Will, the Reputation, the Demand!</p>

<p>This is the <i>real asset</i>&mdash;<span class="smcapall">THE ONLY ASSET WORTH HAVING</span>.</p>

<p>This asset, in equity and good conscience, <i>belongs to me, by the most
sacred of all titles</i>&mdash;<span class="smcapall">THE WORKMAN&#8217;S RIGHT TO THE PRODUCT OF HIS LABOR</span>.</p>

<p>Since it is mine, I mean to have it&mdash;in spite of all that Col. Mann
may do.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Explanatory</span>&#8221; will seek in vain to convince any considerable
number of people that I quit the Magazine on a mere question of salary.</p>

<p><i>That is the very thing that I always subordinated to other and higher
considerations.</i></p>

<p>In some directions Col. Mann lavished money like a prince; in others,
he doled it out like a miser.</p>

<p>Thus he squandered $12,000 in advertisements in daily newspapers,
where they were not worth a hill of beans, and <span class="smcapall">REFUSED TO FURNISH MONEY
TO PAY ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY POSTAGE</span> on sample copies.</p>

<p>He wasted $5,000 trying to run the advertising department on a
fancy schedule, and <span class="smcap">refused to pay the Authors who supplied us with
the necessaries of life</span>. Sometimes the writers who had been so badly
treated had to threaten attachments, before they could get their money;
and upon one occasion <span class="smcap">DeFrance had to sneak out of the office to
avoid an irate Author who had come upon the scene with the Riot
Act in his hand</span>.</p>

<p>Talk about <i>me</i> as the man who acted as if I wanted to &#8220;wreck&#8221; my
namesake? What could damage the Magazine more surely and seriously
than such management as <i>this</i>? We got a bad name among <i>writers</i>,
because we took their MSS. and then failed to pay. We got a bad name
among <i>advertisers</i>, because ads were inserted upon almost any terms.
We got a bad name among <i>subscribers</i>, because DeFrance allowed business
letters to go unanswered, and because Wm. Green, the Publisher, dribbled
the mailing of every issue through <span class="smcapall">TWO FULL WEEKS</span>.</p>

<p>These were the difficulties with which I had to contend. The country
is full of people who wanted to patronize us and befriend us and help<span class="pagenum" id="Page20">[20]</span>
us, but who became so disgusted at not getting their magazines, and not
getting answers to their letters, that they simply quit us in despair.</p>

<p><i>Would DeFrance like to see a list of their names?</i></p>

<p>I can furnish him with a good long one.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>On one occasion Col. Mann was eager to have me send a cablegram,
through our State Department, to our Minister at St. Petersburg, offering
a thousand dollars to Maxim Gorky&mdash;then in prison&mdash;for an article for
the Magazine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">That very week I had to take the money out of my pocket to
pay the girls who worked in the office.</span></p>

<p>Upon another occasion, he ordered the sale, <span class="smcapall">AS JUNK</span>, of 60,000 copies
of the Magazine <span class="smcapall">WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN WRAPPED AND ADDRESSED AND
MADE READY FOR MAILING AS SAMPLE COPIES</span>. They were <span class="smcapall">SOLD AS WASTE
PAPER BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO FURNISH MONEY TO PAY POSTAGE</span>.</p>

<p>Colonel Mann&#8217;s business was the publishing of magazines. Naturally,
I assumed that <i>he was an expert at that business</i>. It never
occurred to me that I could be of any service in the business management
until his absurd mistakes forced themselves upon my attention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Collier trial seemed to establish the fact that his way of
making money out of his other magazines was the systematic blackmailing
of Society swells and Wall Street thieves.</span></p>

<p>When he stands his trial for Perjury in the case now pending, the
world will doubtless learn other peculiarities which characterize his
management of magazines.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>I wanted the Magazine to be a success, and I knew that it could <i>not</i>
succeed as then managed. Hence, my offer to continue, indefinitely, to
work without compensation provided I were allowed to make those
changes which I knew to be absolutely essential to final success.</p>

<p>To this effect I wrote to the Managing Editor, and to DeFrance. No
reply was made by the management.</p>

<p>Then I overcame my repugnance to Col. Mann, and wrote <i>him</i>&mdash;telling
him what ailed the Magazine, how it could be put on its feet and
offering to make a success, of it&mdash;without salary in the meanwhile&mdash;if he
would let me do it.</p>

<p>To my original conditions, however, I added another, namely, <span class="smcap">that
DeFrance must go</span>. After the way in which he had acted, and after
the two insulting letters which he had written me, it was no longer
possible for us to work together.</p>

<p>Col. Mann did not answer my letter at all.</p>

<p>He had <i>DeFrance</i> to telegraph me <i>a request</i> that I send the Editorials,
and <i>a promise</i> that they would treat me right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page21">[21]</span></p>

<p>By having DeFrance send the message, I knew that he meant to keep
DeFrance&mdash;and that let me out.</p>

<p>DeFrance had already notified me that half of my magazine belonged
to <i>him</i>, and half to Col. Mann, and there was no arrangement that could
be made on that basis.</p>

<p>Besides, Col. Mann, after my letter was written and before its receipt,
by him, had rushed into the New York <i>World</i> with an interview which
libelled me basely and cruelly.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>Let me say, in justice to a most estimable gentleman, that I had no
quarrel with Mr. Richard Duffy. He is peculiarly well fitted to make a
first-class editor of a literary magazine. His standards are high and his
judgment sound. He was not, however, particularly suited to a political
magazine&mdash;never having devoted any special study to Political Economy
and Governmental questions. In my contemplated change in the Editorial
Staff, I was not actuated by any dislike of Mr. Duffy. My motive was
simply that of the mariner who sacrifices a portion of his cargo to save
his ship.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Explanatory</span>&#8221; makes as much as possible out of the weekly cheque
of $125, sent to me &#8220;during the busy part of the subscription season.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, they sent me cheques to the amount of one thousand dollars,
at a time when <i>subscriptions were pouring in at the rate of two and three
thousand per week</i>.</p>

<p>But &#8220;<span class="smcap">Explanatory</span>&#8221; does not state the fact that <span class="smcap">nine thousand
dollars represents the amount of unpaid honest, hard work done by
me on the Magazine</span> and that Col. Mann told the newspaper reporters,
brazenly, that <span class="smcapall">HE NEVER INTENDED TO PAY A RED CENT OF IT</span>.</p>

<p><i>Perhaps</i>, the sum-total paid me during the two years <i>would cover my
actual expense-account in working for the Magazine</i>. It certainly would
not do more than that.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Explanatory</span>&#8221; dwells upon my ceasing to visit New York, once a
month.</p>

<p>Drawing no salary, paying my own traveling expenses, and being
made more or less ill by each of these long trips, I discontinued them.
Editorials for a monthly magazine can be written down here in Georgia
just about as well as in New York, and postage stamps cost less than
railroad tickets.</p>

<p>Everything that I was allowed to do for the Magazine could be
done just as well by mail as by personal presence.</p>

<p>As to refusing to make a final trip to seek &#8220;an amicable adjustment,&#8221;
I wrote to DeFrance that the proposition referred to already <span class="smcapall">WAS MY<span class="pagenum" id="Page22">[22]</span>
LAST WORD</span>, and that there was no use in my coming to New York to say
it again. Col. Mann could accept or reject&mdash;I was not going there to
listen to any more of his coaxing, bluffing and lies.</p>

<p>Besides, to tell the whole truth, I was not sorry that <span class="smcap">the time had
come when I could cut loose from this fat rascal</span>. <i>After</i> I had
worked on and on; <i>after</i> he had broken promise upon promise; <i>after</i> he
had sued the Magazine for $60,000 and got an execution against it; <i>after</i>
he had shown that he wanted me to continue indefinitely to do ten times
as much work as the contract called for, and to <i>never have any share in
the reward that might be reaped from my labors</i>; <i>after</i> he had broken
the contract by dismissing my son from a position which was my personal
appointment; <i>after</i> he had rushed into the newspapers and confirmed my
suspicion of his villainous purpose by revealing his utter and shameless
disregard for his contracts, <span class="smcapall">THEN</span> my conscience and my judgment concurred
in the decision to cut loose from the New York concern and <span class="smcapall">START
A MAGAZINE OF MY OWN</span>.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>Not a second thought have I given to the loss of the $9,000. But
<span class="smcapall">THAT</span> wasn&#8217;t all. Col. Mann assailed me. The odium of a catastrophe
which was the result of his own folly, faithlessness and lack of honor,
he tried to cast upon me. In his efforts to escape universal contempt, he
lied like a bulletin.</p>

<p>Betrayed by one whom I selected as my personal representative in
the office and whom I advanced from Circulation Clerk to Business
Manager; accused of a mismanagement which I endeavored in vain to
correct; held up to public criticism for mistreatment of employes when
I had never uttered an unkind word to a single one of them, high or low,
during the whole time of my service, and when I had never made a change
in the force that was not sanctioned in advance, by Colonel Mann himself,
I now feel that burning sense of the injustice and outrage which any
other man of spirit would feel under the same circumstances.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>With an effrontery which nothing could surpass, the two men who
have seized my magazine on the half and half plan <i>are mailing out a
circular letter begging Reformers to take shares in the stock of the new
Company</i>.</p>

<p>This circular carries Deception on its very face. It purports to hail
from &#8220;<i>2 West 40th Street</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>What is &#8220;2 West 40th Street&#8221;?</p>

<p>Why, <span class="smcap">it is the side-door to the notorious Town Topics den into
which DeFrance and Col. Mann have dragged the corpse of</span> &#8220;<span class="smcap">Watson&#8217;s
Magazine</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapall">FRONT</span> of Col. Mann&#8217;s trap is on <span class="smcap">Fifth Avenue</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span></p>

<p>Now DeFrance and Mann <i>knew very well that there wasn&#8217;t a decent
man in America who would knowingly send a dollar to buy stock of Col.
Mann at the Town Topics address</i>. Hence in their efforts to lure pigeons
into the net, they use <i>the side-door address which no one who is not
familiar with the building would ever know to be the same building</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oh, the shame of it, DeFrance!</span> And <span class="smcapall">YOU</span> were the man whom I
selected <span class="smcapall">AS MY PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE IN THE OFFICE</span>, and who <span class="smcap">telegraphed
me to Fort Lauderdale last winter urging me to resist
Col. Mann&#8217;s removal of the Magazine to the Town Topics building</span>!</p>

<p>With pathetic insistence, they are sending out this circular letter
from this Town Topics Side-Entrance addressed,</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Dear Friend.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>I wonder how many dear friends Col. Mann imagines himself to
possess.</p>

<p><i>I wonder how many of DeFrance&#8217;s dear friends will follow him into</i>
<span class="smcap">that Mann-hole</span>.</p>

<p>The letter makes the modest request that a few thousand ardent
admirers of DeFrance buy stock in the Side-Door concern at $10 per share.</p>

<p>DeFrance tearfully ejaculates, &#8220;<i>I don&#8217;t ask you to donate the Money.
Far from it.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p><i>How</i> far from it, he doesn&#8217;t say. <i>The confiding individual who bites
at that bait, and pours ten dollars into that Mann-hole will see a good
deal of ice in August before he will ever see his money again.</i></p>

<p>Think of the impudent falsehood of the assertion made in this circular
letter:</p>

<p>&#8220;The magazine, while not yet profitable, has nearly reached that
point.&#8221; Therefore, send your money to the Side-Door concern right
away. Yet, in the next breath, he claims that Col. Mann lost $180,000 in
less than two years on the Magazine.</p>

<p>To cap the climax of his wrong-doing, DeFrance actually signs the
Begging Letter as <i>Secretary of the People&#8217;s Party National Committee</i>.</p>

<p>By what right?</p>

<p>Under whose authority does he act <i>when he thus prostitutes that
office to the service of Col. W. D. Mann</i>?</p>

<p>What will our National Committee think of it when they <i>behold their
Secretary standing at the Side Door of the Town Topics building and
hear him calling for Populists to walk up and enter the Mann-hole, to the
tune of</i> &#8220;<span class="smcap">Ten Dollars admission fee, please</span>&#8221;?</p>

<p>DeFrance has now stooped <i>to do the very thing that Col. Mann tried
vainly to get me to do</i>.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>I wonder if those New York rascals really thought that I would
quietly sit down and twiddle my thumbs while they were making off
with &#8220;Watson&#8217;s Magazine&#8221;? I wonder if it never entered into those<span class="pagenum" id="Page25">[25]</span>
heads, which were bent together to plot and to scheme, that the consequence
of their pretty little game <span class="smcapall">MIGHT</span> be a Revolt of Watson and <span class="smcapall">HIS
FRIENDS</span>.</p>

<p>Unless I am greatly mistaken, <i>the subscribers</i> to &#8220;Watson&#8217;s Magazine&#8221;
<i>are Mr. Watson&#8217;s friends</i>, and <span class="smcapall">THEY ARE GOING TO STAND BY HIM</span>.
We shall see.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>After all, why worry over it? Life is too short to waste many of its
precious hours upon such a theme. Looked at in one way, those who
thought to crush me have done me a service.</p>

<p>They have put into me, once more, that intensity of energy and
purpose which, otherwise, might never have been mine again. What the
spur is to the thoroughbred, what the bugle-call is to the cavalier, the
recent attempts of my enemies to compass my ruin has been to me.</p>

<p>By the living God! <span class="smcap">Here</span> is no thought of surrender, no weakness
of doubt or hesitation, but a resolution, fixed as hardened steel, to
<span class="smcapall">MARCH ON</span>.</p>

<p>What! Be a quitter <span class="smcapall">NOW</span>? Falter or flicker <span class="smcapall">NOW</span>? Lower the flag
and stack arms, <span class="smcapall">NOW</span>?</p>

<p>Rather, would I die.</p>

<p>The ear of the world is at last inclined to us, and the heart of
mankind is at length being touched by our message.</p>

<p>The long march of the despised Reformer is nearing its end. His
final triumph no sane observer, no watchman upon the tower, can longer
doubt.</p>

<p>Halt <span class="smcapall">NOW</span>? Never in the world.</p>

<p>Desert <span class="smcapall">NOW</span>? Heaven forbid!</p>

<p>Why, for fifteen years we have walked amid the shadows of social
and political ostracism, never swerving an inch from the rocky road of
Duty&mdash;do they think we shall walk less firmly <i>now</i>, when the sunlight is
falling upon the path?</p>

<p>Times have changed. Men have changed. The principles for
which we fought have <i>not</i> changed. <span class="smcap">They have conquered.</span></p>

<p>The strong man and shrewd politician at the White House laid
his attentive ear to the ground, quite a while ago, and heard distant
rumblings that taught him useful lessons.</p>

<p>The strong man and shrewd politician at Fair View, Nebraska, has
had his attentive ear to the ground and he, likewise, has learned his lesson.</p>

<p>The next time Mr. Watson of Georgia goes to Nebraska for the
purpose of helping Mr. Bryan to carry his home State for Reform, I
venture the prediction that Mr. Bryan will not leave Nebraska to avoid
contact with Mr. Watson&mdash;as he did in 1896.</p>

<p>The battle-flag of a great people, inspired by a resistless purpose
to assert the right of <span class="smcapall">THE INDIVIDUAL</span> to wrest the government
of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span>
country out of the hands of the <span class="smcapall">MONSTER CORPORATION</span> will, beyond all
possible doubt, be inscribed with those mottoes which for fifteen years
have been our watchwords in the fight and our solace in defeat.</p>

<p>Courage, Comrades&mdash;<span class="smcap">Courage</span>! And <span class="smcap">Forward March</span>!</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>On this mellow, radiant, opulent day of Indian Summer&mdash;when the
golden hours step quietly by, leading November into the dim realms
which we call the Past&mdash;I write these lines; and, having done so, cast
behind me that ugly dream, my New York experience.</p>

<p>Betrayed, <i>I will trust again</i>, <span class="smcapall">AND GO ON</span>. Better ten thousand treacheries
<i>than loss of faith</i> in my fellow man. Repulsed, I will rally, re-form,
and <span class="smcapall">CHARGE AGAIN</span>. Better a hundred defeats than one capitulation.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>In March 1898, the Populists nominated me for Governor of Georgia.
In declining to make the race, my decision was controlled by the fact
that our organization had been wrecked by the Traitors who controlled
our National Committee, that I myself was exhausted&mdash;mentally, physically,
financially&mdash;and that Populism must henceforth do its work as <span class="smcapall">A
LEAVEN TO THE LOAF</span>.</p>

<p>The fatal Fusion of 1896 had done our organization deadly damage,
and the Spanish War finished us.</p>

<p>The blare of the bugle drowned the voice of the Reformer. With
the Cannon-boom shaking the world, men had no ear for Political economy&mdash;or
economy of any other sort.</p>

<p>Roosevelt rushed into war paint, and leaped into fame.</p>

<p>Bryan stuck a feather in his cap, and vowed that he, too, would
become a soldier in spite of those vile guns.</p>

<p>Hearst, also, went as close to the enemy as McKinley would let him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">How could I talk economics with any prospect of success at
such a time?</span></p>

<p>Loathing the war, foreseeing many of the evil consequences that it
has brought upon us, I quit the active agitation of Populism, and shut
myself up in my library to write books. <i>But if any soldier of the Southern
Confederacy carried away from Appomattox a heavier heart than I
took with me into my enforced retirement</i>, <span class="smcap">it would have been a merciful
dispensation of Providence had the Eternal Sleep taken that
soldier into her cold, white arms</span>.</p>

<p>What I suffered during those awful years is known to none but the
wife who shared my lot and the God who gave me strength to endure it.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>To continue a hopeless fight with a broken-down organization was
not the part of wisdom. The thing to do was to wait, educate the people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span>
let events demonstrate that we had been right, and let the Spirit of
Populism enter into and inspire the leaders of other parties.</p>

<p>I knew that <span class="smcapall">OUR PRINCIPLES</span> would finally triumph&mdash;as to <span class="smcapall">THE PARTY</span>,
that was a secondary consideration.</p>

<p>In taking leave of my comrades in 1898, before quitting the field to
go back into the court-house to earn money to pay pressing debts, here is
what my letter said to them:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let no man believe that I despair of your principles, for I do not.
You stand for the yearning, upward-tendency, of the middle and lower
classes. You stand where the reformer has always stood; for improvement,
for beneficial changes, for recognition of human brotherhood in its
highest sense, for equality before the law, and for an industrial system
which is not based upon the right of the strong to pillage the weak. You
stand as sworn foes of monopoly&mdash;not monopoly in the narrow sense of
the word&mdash;but monopoly of power, of place, of privilege, of wealth, of
progress.</p>

<p>&#8220;You stand knocking at the closed door of privilege, as the reformer
has ever done, and saying to those within, &#8216;Open wide the doors! Let all
who are worthy, enter. Let all who deserve, enjoy. Form no conspiracy
against the unborn. Shut out no generations that are to be. God made
it all for all. Put no barrier around the good things of life, around the
high places of church or state. Make no laws which foster inequality.
Establish no Caste. Legalize no robbery under the name of taxes. Give
to no person natural or artificial sovereign powers over his fellow men.
Open, open wide the doors! Keep the avenues of honor free. Close no
entrance to the poorest, the weakest, the humblest. Say to ambition
everywhere, the field is clear, the contest fair, come and win your share
if you can!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such is Populism. Such is its glorious Gospel. As such, I have
loved it with boundless reverence. As its disciples, I have loved <i>you</i>,
fought for you, toiled for you, <i>never for one moment doubting that you
were right</i>, and that your creed was the same immortal creed which in all
ages has challenged wrong, and defied oppression.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>Trample the Truth as rudely as you may, even in her death struggle
her voice is heard to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I will come again.</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>In the darkest hours of the past, when all seemed lost and the weaklings,
the timeservers, the fickle minded and the mercenaries were fleeing
to cover, I used to say, constantly, confidently, &#8220;<i>Courage</i>, friends. Be
<i>firm</i>. <span class="smcap">Don&#8217;t lose heart.</span> It will all come right.</p>

<p>&#8220;Populism, as a party, may seem to be dead, but the Spirit is immortal.
It cannot die. As sure as God lives,</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">It will come again.</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>And now, after many days, in God&#8217;s own time, it <span class="smcapall">HAS</span> come again.
From the bottom of my heart and from yours, come <i>thanks to the Lord
of the Universe who spared our lives to see this day</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span></p>

<p>And the purpose to which every energy I possess shall be devoted,
henceforth, is <span class="smcap">to help those whom the people commission to bring
about Reform</span>.</p>

<p>As to Reward, I seek none, expect none, save that of the <i>Inner
Voice</i> which says,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Well Done.</span></p>

<p>With this glance into the Past, necessary to <i>you</i>, as well as to <i>me</i>, let
us turn our backs to it, and face the Future&mdash;and let us <span class="smcapall">WORK</span>, as we
never worked before.</p>

<p>We know not <i>what may be within</i>;

<p>Lost, forever lost, is <i>the Confidence</i>
with which we <i>used</i> to go bounding

<p>We have met the Unforeseen so

ignorance of what it all may

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>Have mercy on us, Father Time.
We have been beaten with many

<p>We knew <i>nothing</i> at the beginning,

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>We shudder when we think of what

Father Time.</p>

<p>Ah, but you were hard on us&mdash;<i>bitter

they died like flies, in noisome, reeking,

<p>Ah, it was pitiful, Father Time!</p>

<p>Our feeble ones, young and old,
<i>perished miserably of cold and hunger</i>,
in the midst of a land that worships

looked down upon a newly-made
world.</p>

<p>Poverty, Crime, Vice, Drunkenness,

their awful appetites upon us during
the Old Year, Father Time. To <span class="smcapall">WHAT</span>

<p>Oh, Father Time! We tremble as
we feel you leading us toward the
door of the New Year. Beyond that
portal we cannot see, and <i>we dread it&mdash;as
children dread the dark</i>.</p>

<p>Deal gently with us in the New

<h3>Mr. Bryan and Mr. Watson.</h3>

<p>When I was in Nebraska in 1904
Mr. Bryan showed me every courtesy;
therefore, it was most appropriate for
me to reciprocate at the first opportunity.
When Mr. Bryan reached the
State of Georgia, during his recent
tour of the South, I wrote him a note
which he gave to the press, and which
our readers have doubtless seen.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards the following
personal acknowledgement was received:</p>

<div class="bryanletter">

<p class="right padr2">September 22nd, 1906.</p>

<p class="noindent">Hon. Thos. E. Watson.</p>

<p>My Dear Mr. Watson:</p>

<p>I received your letter at Augusta
and thank you very much for your
cordial greeting.</p>

<p>I am sorry that it was impossible
for us to stop over with you. It is
gratifying to know from what I have
learned that we are going to be able
to act together in the coming contest.
There has been a remarkable change
in public sentiment, so that things
that were formerly denounced as
radical are now regarded as not only
quite reasonable, but even necessary.
If you come our way, we shall be
glad again to see you, only hoping
that you may have more time than
when you last visited us. Mrs. Bryan
joins me in best wishes.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr10">Very truly yours,</span><br />
<span class="padr4">W. J. BRYAN.</span></p>

</div><!--bryanletter-->

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>Mr. Bryan says: &#8220;<i>It is gratifying
to know from what I have learned
that we are going to be able to act
together in the coming contest.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing would give me greater
pleasure than to see the National
Democratic party undergo a general
casting out of the unclean spirits that
have taken possession of it. If it
should become truly Democratic, if it
should return to the principles of the
fathers, if it should renounce Hamilton
and all his works, if it should
rebaptize itself in the creed of Jefferson,
if its National organization should
expel every tool of the Trusts, every
agent of Wall street, every beneficiary
of special Privilege&mdash;<i>then the Democratic
party would stand for substantially
the same things as The People&#8217;s
Party</i>.</p>

<p>That being so, why should we not
be able &#8220;to act together?&#8221;</p>

<p>Party <i>names</i> are nothing. <i>Principles</i>
are everything. True reformers
think more of <i>having the work done</i>
than of <i>getting the credit</i>. Many
Populists condemned me in 1905 for
advising them to support Hoke Smith
for Governor of Georgia. <i>No Populist
condemns me now.</i> <span class="smcap">Everybody
realizes that there are more Populists
in Georgia today than there
ever were before.</span></p>

<p>Read once more the strong, manly
letter which Hoke Smith wrote for the
first issue of the Weekly Jeffersonian,
and then remember that thirteen
years ago the writer was a member
of Cleveland&#8217;s Cabinet&mdash;<i>then</i> you will
realize how immensely <i>the man has
grown</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span></p>

<p>Well, his Democratic followers have
grown with him, and we Jeffersonians
vastly outnumber the moss-backs
throughout the State of Georgia.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>As Mr. Bryan says, <i>a great change
is coming over the people</i>. Doctrines
which were scouted a few years ago
are shouted now. Radicals who were
hooted, howled down and rotten-egged
a few years ago are getting bouquets
now. <i>The Hearst editorials and
speeches read like Populist harangues
of 1892.</i> <span class="smcap">The Bryan platform of
1906 embraces what was considered
the wildest plank of the People&#8217;s
Party platform of 1891.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Act together,&#8221; William? Why
not&mdash;<i>if you take our principles for
your creed and reorganize your old
party to fit your new faith?</i></p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>That all true reformers may find
a way to &#8220;act together&#8221; is a consummation
devoutly to be wished. A
conference between Bryan, Hearst
and myself for that purpose was suggested
immediately after the election
of 1904, but neither Mr. Bryan nor
Mr. Hearst seemed to approve.</p>

<p>What may happen between now and
1908 no one can foretell, but I am
<i>still hoping that some honorable plan
may be hit upon which will enable all
true-hearted reformers to</i> &#8220;<i>act</i> <span class="smcapall">TOGETHER</span>&#8221;
<i>and overthrow this fearful
system which enables the privileged
few to plunder the unprivileged many</i>.</p>

<h3>Socialism at War with Love of Home and Country.</h3>

<p>In a recent issue of a leading Socialist
paper the following gem of thought
is to be found:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<span class="smcap">Patriotism</span>&#8217; <i>is a nickname for</i>
&#8216;<span class="smcap">Prejudice</span>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Do you know why the Socialist
flouts <i>patriotism</i> and calls it <i>prejudice</i>?</p>

<p>Think a little, and you will see.
You love your <i>country</i> because your
<i>home</i> is a part of it; and you love
your <i>home</i> because it is <i>your individual
haven of refuge from the
storms of life</i>&mdash;the individual kingdom
in which you are lord and master
and in which you enjoy, with your
wife, your children, and your friends,
whatever happiness life can give.</p>

<p><i>The man never lived who would</i>
<span class="smcapall">NOT</span> <i>fight for his home</i>&mdash;<span class="smcapall">HOWEVER
HUMBLE</span>.</p>

<p>The man never lived who <i>would</i>
fight for the tenement house in which
he chances to be a lodger. <span class="smcap">The home
is ever sacred</span>&mdash;the <i>hotel</i> never is.
The reason is plain enough. The
home is yours, <i>individually</i>; the hotel
is everybody&#8217;s <i>generally</i>. Now, the
Socialist strikes at <i>individualism</i>. He
doesn&#8217;t want to own your home by
any title that gives you individual
control of it. <i>He wants everybody&#8217;s
home to belong to you, and your
home to belong to everybody.</i> In
other words, the homes of the people
are to be owned collectively. If society
sees fit to say to you &#8220;<span class="smcap">Move
on</span>,&#8221; out you go. Society will substitute
<i>its</i> title for <i>your</i> title, <i>its</i>
will for <i>your</i> will, <i>its</i> control for <i>your</i>
control. The home that Socialism will
permit you to use this year may be
allotted to some one else another year.</p>

<p><i>Under these conditions no man
would love his home any more than
he would love his room in a hotel.</i>
Under these conditions, the citizen
would have <i>no greater inducement to
make permanent improvements upon
his home, than he would have to make
improvements upon the hotel</i>.</p>

<p>Love of home being destroyed, love
of country would also be destroyed.
Patriotism, being founded upon love<span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span>
of home, would perish under Socialism,
for the simple reason that the
foundations would be gone. <i>Under
Socialism, the most beautiful feature
of civilized life would disappear.</i>
Home life, as we know it, would be
impossible. The song of &#8220;Home, Sweet

<h3>National Finance Run Mad.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The Washington Post</span> is authority
for the statement that the President
will, in his next Message, <i>again</i> urge
upon Congress the necessity for Currency
Reform.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapall">MONEY QUESTION</span>, as you will
remember <span class="smcapall">IS SETTLED</span>; it is only <span class="smcapall">THE
CURRENCY</span> that needs <span class="smcapall">REFORM</span>.</p>

<p>Bryan says <span class="smcapall">THE MONEY QUESTION IS
SETTLED</span>; ditto Roosevelt; ditto Secretary
Shaw; <i>ditto the big bugs of</i>
<span class="smcapall">BOTH</span> <i>the dear old political parties</i>.</p>

<p>Yet, with equal unanimity and fervor,
they all say that <span class="smcapall">THE NEED OF CURRENCY
REFORM</span> is something fierce.</p>

<p>Peculiar, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>When <i>the people</i> want financial
legislation that will <i>restore the system
of The Fathers</i>, it is <span class="smcapall">THE MONEY QUESTION</span>,
and it&#8217;s <span class="smcapall">SETTLED</span>. The old party
leaders, one and all, agree upon <span class="smcapall">THAT</span>.</p>

<p>Politically, therefore, <span class="smcapall">THAT</span> question
is <span class="smcap">Res Adjudicata</span>, and must not be
spoken of any more.</p>

<p>But when <i>the corporations</i> want
financial legislation <i>which will tend
still further to make our National
Treasury a huge Reservoir from which
the National Banks and their allies
can draw strength, support and profit</i>&mdash;why,
<span class="smcapall">THEN</span>, it is a matter of <span class="smcapall">CURRENCY
REFORM</span>, and if Congress
doesn&#8217;t give the Money Power everything
it demands, the Country will go
to the &#8220;demnition bow-wows.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s how it is, my son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The moguls of high finance</span>
declare that what our currency system
needs is greater &#8220;<i>elasticity</i>.&#8221; The
India rubber quality is wanting, it
seems. The present system doesn&#8217;t
<i>stretch</i> readily enough. The Moguls
declare that the &#8220;<i>rigidity</i>&#8221; of the
currency system threatens us with
calamitous conditions at the prospect
of which the imagination becomes
exhausted and quits business.</p>

<p>Those two words, &#8220;<i>elasticity</i>&#8221; and
&#8220;<i>rigidity</i>&#8221; are being featured in all
the Mogul talk, all the Mogul papers&mdash;and
are being dutifully repeated by
all the Mogul Senators and Representatives.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yet, there isn&#8217;t a particle of
sound common sense</span> in all this cant
about <i>elasticity</i> and <i>rigidity</i>.</p>

<p>When the currency system of the
body-politic is healthy and normal,
there can be no question of elasticity
and rigidity. Like the circulation of
the blood in the human body, the circulation
of money will take care of
itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Once get the system right, and
nature will do the rest.</span></p>

<p>If the Physician tells you that <span class="smcapall">YOUR
CIRCULATION IS BAD</span>&mdash;you <span class="smcapall">KNOW</span> what
that means.</p>

<p>Your system is out of order. The
blood goes about its business, without
any help from <span class="smcapall">YOU</span>, <span class="smcapall">PROVIDED YOUR
SYSTEM IS KEPT IN ORDER</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> don&#8217;t have to pump blood
away from center to the extremities;
<span class="smcapall">THE BLOOD WILL GO THERE, OF ITSELF,
IF YOUR BODILY SYSTEM IS IN THE
PROPER, NORMAL, SOUND CONDITION</span>.</p>

<p>It is just so with, the circulation of
money in the body politic; if the
system is <span class="smcapall">RIGHT</span>, <span class="smcapall">THE MONEY CIRCULATION
WILL REGULATE ITSELF BY NATURAL
LAWS</span>.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elasticity</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rigidity</span>&mdash;two words
that are cunningly employed to disguise
the purpose of the Moguls of
National finance. <i>Those conspirators
mean to drive the Government still
further away from the Constitutional
system of the Fathers.</i> They mean to
push still further <i>the usurped power
of the National Banks to create and
control the supply and distribution of
the Currency</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Currency Reform&#8221; means nothing
more nor less than that.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Government loans to the common
people</span>, at four per cent, or even at
two per cent, would seem to be <i>more
statesmanlike</i>, in all respects, than
<i>this eternal lending of government
money to Wall Street without any
interest at all</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Why should Uncle Sam furnish
gamblers money to speculate with?</span>
Can any good reason be given for it?
Does it seem to be fair to legitimate
business men? Is it just to the taxpayers?
Can it be <span class="smcapall">RIGHT</span>?</p>

<p>Yet the Wall Street gamblers got
nearly ($30,000,000) thirty million
dollars from the U. S. Treasury in one
lump. Upon this huge sum of public
money, the speculators will pay no
interest at all.</p>

<p>Is it right?</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p><span class="smcap">According to the official statement</span>
for Nov. 12th, 1906, <span class="smcapall">THE GOVERNMENT</span>
has now increased <span class="smcap">its loans
to the National Banks</span> to the stupendous
<span class="smcapall">TOTAL</span> of $147,000,000.</p>

<p>Never before has the gratuitous
loan been so large. Who can defend
such a policy? Who would not <span class="smcapall">BE
ASHAMED</span> to appear before an audience
of intelligent voters to advocate the
wisdom and the propriety of such
<span class="smcapall">GOVERNMENTAL FAVORITISM</span> as this?</p>

<p>You laughed at the Farmers&#8217;
Alliance when it favored government
loans to the people, on the best of
security, at two per cent interest.
Yet you say <i>nothing</i> against government
<i>loans to a few pet National
Banks</i> <span class="smcapall">FREE OF INTEREST</span>, and upon
<span class="smcapall">DOUBTFUL SECURITY</span>.</p>

<p>Part of that <span class="smcapall">LOAN OF ONE HUNDRED
AND FORTY-SEVEN MILLIONS</span> is secured
by Chicago Municipal Bonds, called,
I believe, the Sanitary Bonds. Would
you not prefer to lend <span class="smcapall">YOUR</span> Money
upon a good farm, or <i>upon warehouse
certificates for cotton</i>?</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The farmers</span> would be only too
glad to pay the Government <span class="smcapall">FOUR PER
CENT</span> for that money which <span class="smcapall">THE PET
BANKS GET FOR NOTHING</span>. Four per
cent interest upon one hundred and
forty-seven million dollars is a tidy
sum. Figure it out and you will see,
that it is about <span class="smcapall">SIX MILLION DOLLARS</span>.
That&#8217;s a neat sum to be <span class="smcapall">GIVEN AWAY
EVERY YEAR</span>, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Consider this also</span>: You, the Common
People, are the taxpayers who
put that money into the U. S. Treasury.
<span class="smcap">The pet National Banks pay,
practically, none of it.</span></p>

<p>Yet <span class="smcapall">THEY</span> have the use of <span class="smcapall">YOUR</span>
money <span class="smcapall">FREE</span>. If <span class="smcapall">YOU</span> get the use of a
dollar of it, <span class="smcapall">YOU MUST GO TO THEM
FOR TERMS</span>.</p>

<p><i>Tough</i>, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No wonder the money supply is
congested.</span> So long as the Government
<span class="smcapall">TAXES IT OUT OF THE POCKETS
OF THE MANY</span>, and delivers it over <span class="smcapall">TO
THE FEW</span>, there is <i>bound</i> to be congestion.</p>

<p>Yet, the Pet National Banks are
moving heaven and earth, <span class="smcapall">RIGHT NOW</span>,
to have <span class="smcapall">CONGRESS LEGISLATE IN FAVOR
OF GREATER CONGESTION</span>. The power
of the Few over the Many must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span>
increased by additional legislation.
Otherwise, the bottom will drop out
and Perdition will have us by the
nape of the neck. When eminently
respectable cabinet officers, congressmen,
editors, etc., tell you that <span class="smcapall">THE
PRESENT SYSTEM OF RUNNING THE
FINANCES IN FAVOR OF WALL STREET
SPECULATORS AND PET BANKS</span> is safe
and sane, and that all we need is to
make it a little more so, <span class="smcapall">BELIEVE EVERY
WORD OF IT AND VOTE ACCORDINGLY</span>.</p>

<p>On the contrary, when some discredited
crank tells you that <i>it is an
infernal shame</i> to use the law-making
machinery in that manner, <i>howl him
down</i>, at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don&#8217;t lend to the taxpayer his
own money at four per cent.
That&#8217;s paternalism</span>&mdash;and it <span class="smcapall">STINKS.</span></p>

<p>Take the taxpayers&#8217; money and
<span class="smcapall">LEND IT TO THE PET BANKS</span> without
any interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">That&#8217;s statesmanship</span>&mdash;and it
<span class="smcapall">SMELLS LIKE ATTAR OF ROSES</span>.</p>

<h3>As to Hearst.</h3>

<p>The case against Plutocracy gained
an advance upon the Docket by the
New York gubernatorial contest, but,
unless I am much mistaken, two
national figures came out of it with
mud on their boots.</p>

<p>One of these is W. R. Hearst.</p>

<p>The other is W. J. Bryan.</p>

<p>When Max Ihmsen advised Mr.
Hearst to come to terms with Murphy,
the striped Tammany Boss, he
disgusted thousands of sincere
Hearstites, not only in New York but
throughout the Union.</p>

<p>The deal was <i>too</i> bad.</p>

<p>It took Hearst out of the class of
Reformers and put him into that of
self-seeking Politicians.</p>

<p>It created in the minds of his disinterested
friends the suspicion that
he posed as a Reformer to serve the
purpose of a personal ambition.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>Boss Murphy is a rich specimen of
the Boss&mdash;the man who is in politics
for Money, who cares nothing for
Principle, who has no conception of
Duty, who would not understand what
you meant if you talked to him about
Moral Obligation, who amasses wealth
by screening from adverse legislation
the rascals that rob the Public under
corporate names, who makes it possible
for invaluable public franchises
to be stolen with impunity, and who
renders it easy for the robbers that
grabbed the property to use it to
oppress and exploit the people from
whom it was stolen.</p>

<p>I <i>know</i> that Murphy is the worst
representative of <i>that class of Bosses</i>
because the Hearst newspapers told
me so.</p>

<p>I <i>know</i> that he has used his power,
as Tammany Chief, to protect such
robbers of the Public as Belmont,
Morgan, Rogers and Ryan, because
Mr. Hearst has told me so with
&#8220;damnable iteration&#8221; and convincing
emphasis these many years.</p>

<p>At the breakfast table, he reminded
me of it in his morning paper, <i>The
American</i>.</p>

<p>At the supper table, he recalled the
fact to my memory in his evening
paper, <i>The Journal</i>.</p>

<p>In fact, he gave me no chance to
forget it.</p>

<p>Murphy, a protector of Crime,
Murphy, a tool of the Plunderbund;
Murphy, the stuffer of ballot-boxes;
Murphy, the ally of Murderers and
thieves; Murphy, the inciter to assassination;
Murphy, who robbed New
York in the interest of Ryan and Belmont;<span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span>
Murphy, who ought to be in the
Penitentiary garbed in convict stripes&mdash;<span class="smcapall">THIS</span>
Murphy became so familiar
to me in the Hearst newspapers that I
would have felt the loss of something
habitual, and therefore necessary, had
my friend Hearst ceased to grind the
coffee-mill.</p>

<p class="caption">DREAMING OF 1908.</p>
</div>

<p>Yet Max Ihmsen deliberately
planned a coalition between denouncer<span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span>
and denounced, between the Angel of
Reform and the Devil of Plutocracy,
between the Champion of the &#8220;Common
People&#8221; and the hireling of the
Plunderbund, between the man who
cried &#8220;Stop thief&#8221; and the rogue who
was making off with the stolen goods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It was too bad</span>.</p>

<p>It shocked the <i>Sense of Right</i> of
ten thousands of enthusiastic Hearstites
who had believed in him as an
<i>honest</i> leader.&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>See <i>the Consequences</i> of this foul
and fatal deal:</p>

<p>First&mdash;the loss of that most valuable
asset, the real reformers of The
Independence League;</p>

<p>Second&mdash;the revulsion of feeling
among disinterested Democrats and
Republicans who were supporting
Hearst <i>on principle</i>;</p>

<p>Third&mdash;the calling back to robust
life of the almost defunct Boss,
Murphy;</p>

<p>Fourth&mdash;the complete rehabilitation
of Tammany;</p>

<p>Fifth&mdash;the surrender to the Plunderbund
of the State Supreme Court
<i>for fourteen years</i>;</p>

<p>Sixth&mdash;the restoration to his place
of power and hurtfulness of Thomas
Grady, the most debauched legislative
corruptionist in America.</p>

<p>I <i>know</i> that Grady is that kind of
man, because the Hearst papers have
assured me of it so often that no doubt
upon the subject disturbs the absolute
serenity of my fixed opinion.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>As these <i>net results</i> of the New
York election loom up clearly above
the dust and noise of the conflict, it is
natural that Mr. Hearst will be seen
to have dimmed his halo very considerably;
and <i>the fact that Murphy</i>,
after securing to himself and his gang
all the benefits of the coalition, <i>turned
upon Hearst at the last moment and
put the knife into him</i>, will cause no
tears <span class="smcapall">ANYWHERE</span>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s just what Hearst ought to
have known would happen&mdash;for he
had said things about Murphy which
<i>no man</i>, born of woman, <i>could possibly
forgive</i>.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>But Bryan put a shadow upon <i>his</i>
radiance, also.</p>

<p>He swallowed the Hearst programme
all the way through&mdash;from
soup and fish to cheese and coffee.
<i>His stomach balked at nothing.</i> The
ousting of Democratic delegations
which had been elected to the Buffalo
Convention; the packing of that Convention
with delegations which had
not been elected; the throw down of
The Independence League; the guillotining
of the Independent candidates;
the repudiation of the honest labor-champion,
Thomas Rock, and the
endorsement of the Plunderbund corruptionist,
Thomas Grady; the fix-up
of the Judiciary ticket in which three
Judges were allotted to Hearst while
Murphy calmly pocketed seven&mdash;Bryan&#8217;s
gorge rose at none of these
things. One and all, they slid down
his gullet like rain-water down a tin
valley.</p>

<p>Just think if it!</p>

<p>In 1904, Bryan was making 60
speeches a day for Parker&mdash;Judge
Alton B. Parker&mdash;whom he described
as &#8220;the Moses of Democracy.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1906, he was writing, telegraphing,
telephoning and so forth for W.
R. Hearst, <i>the exact</i> <span class="smcapall">CONTRAST</span> <i>to
Parker</i>.</p>

<p>Heavens, what a leap!</p>

<p>From Parker to Hearst&mdash;from
Greenland&#8217;s icy mountains to India&#8217;s
coral strand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Never</span> saw such a jump before in
my life.</p>

<p>And Bryan is going to find that it
will require considerable dexterity to
fit his crown on straight, after <i>that</i>
trouser-splitting leap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hearst</span> has not changed <i>in principle</i>;
<span class="smcap">Parker</span> has not changed <i>in
principle</i>; yet within two short years
<span class="smcap">Mr. Bryan</span> <i>has advocated</i> <span class="smcapall">EACH OF
THEM</span> <i>with equal fervor</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span></p>

<p>Quit playing Politician, William,
or you will do yourself irreparable
injury.</p>

<p><i>Fly your flag</i> <span class="smcap">as Reformer</span> and
hold your sword <i>straight before you</i>.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t again call such a man as
Parker &#8220;the Moses of Democracy.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Ornamental Flag Poles&mdash;Eastern Insurance Companies.</h3>

<p>The Pennsylvania politicians decided
that the state needed a new
Capitol. The people were told that
unless a better state house were erected
Pennsylvania would be pointed
at with scorn, viewed with alarm, and
otherwise treated in a disrespectful
and uncomfortable manner.</p>

<p>So, the politicians, contractors, material
men, jobbers, lobbyists, dead-beats,
plain thieves and so forth, went
forward and in due time a new capitol
for Pennsylvania was evolved.</p>

<p>Costing how much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thirteen million dollars, my son.</span></p>

<p>The house, itself, cost only $4,000,000.</p>

<p>But, then, you see, it had to be furnished.</p>

<p>The &#8220;furnishings&#8221; of the new state
house cost the tax payers of Pennsylvania
$9,000,000.</p>

<p>As a sample of said furnishings,
consider the one item of flag staff.</p>

<p>What would such a magnificent
new capitol be without a flag flying
above it?</p>

<p><i>Of course</i>, the state house must be
surmounted by the flag.</p>

<p>And how can the flag do itself
credit, away up there in the heavens,
without a pole to fly from?</p>

<p><i>Of course</i>, there must be a flag pole.</p>

<p>So, the pole was put in place, and
the flag was braced to the pole.</p>

<p>At what cost, please?</p>

<p>Why, the flag pole cost $850. Not
$8.50, but $850.</p>

<p>So, at least, it appears upon the
expense-account.</p>

<p>What was the flag pole made of?</p>

<p>Why, <i>it was just the round body of
a large pine tree</i>.</p>

<p>Nothing else, my son.</p>

<p>The probability is that any sawmill
in the country would have furnished
such a tree for $25.</p>

<p>The labor of preparing the tree for
use as a flag pole might have cost
another $25.</p>

<p>Fifty dollars ought to have covered
the entire cost.</p>

<p>But then, you see, the gang that
was bossing the job needed money;
therefore, the State of Pennsylvania
was supplied with a fifty-dollar flag
pole for the moderate sum of $850.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>But the country is adorned with
numerous <i>other flag poles of the same
variety</i>.</p>

<p>One of them is <span class="smcap">Paul Morton</span>,
President of <span class="smcap">The Equitable Assurance
Society</span>.</p>

<p>No institution in this land of the
free has a flag pole that is more
expensive.</p>

<p>Paul Morton costs the policy holders
of the Equitable $80,000 per year.
Not $8,000&mdash;which would be a fair
price&mdash;but $80,000&mdash;which is a gouge.</p>

<p>Just how many men, equally capable,
could be found to fill his place at
$10,000 per year, it would be impossible
to say; but there is no doubt
whatever that Paul himself would<span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span>
have served the Society just as well
upon a salary of $25,000.</p>

<p>But then, you see, he wanted more.
So he took it.</p>

<p>Flag poles come high&mdash;under certain
circumstances.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>Life Insurance, properly done, is of
vast benefit to the Insured. Life
Insurance, improperly done, is of vast
benefit,&mdash;to the Insurer. Those Eastern
Companies got too gay. Their
higher officers became corrupt. Under
various flimsy pretexts, they began
to plunder the Insured. <i>Local agents,
who did the hard work, got small pay.</i>
State agents and National officers
drew princely salaries,&mdash;and did little
to show for it.</p>

<p>Some of those Eastern Companies
have been building Insurance Business
on the same principle that gave an
exhibition of itself in the building of
the new State House of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that the taxpayers
of Pennsylvania have been robbed.
Everybody knows, equally well, that
the Policy-holders of those Eastern
Companies have been plundered.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of such rascals
as the McCurdy gang, the Policy-holder
resembled an Irish potato, in
that <i>he had eyes yet saw not</i>.</p>

<p>The blind Policy-holder, <i>who could
never see that he was being robbed</i>,
became a jest among the thieves who
spent his money in riotous living.</p>

<p>Life Insurance is all right&mdash;<i>when
the Insurer is</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> you allow the Insurance
Company to examine <span class="smcapall">YOU</span>, <i>examine the

<h3>Abraham Lincoln&#8217;s Silly Biographers.</h3>

<p>The process of making a saint out of
Abraham Lincoln goes bravely on.
His latest biographer, Mr. Hill, clears
him of the charge of &#8220;telling stories
just to amuse people.&#8221; Mr. Hill&mdash;a
sober and worthy man, no doubt&mdash;produces
a witness by the name of
Ewing, who being duly sworn, deposes
and says:</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard Mr. Lincoln tell a
story for its own sake or simply to
raise a laugh. He used stories to
illustrate a point, but the idea that
he sat around and matched yarns like
a commercial traveller is utterly
false.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why should the Lincoln biographers
strive and strain to establish the
fact that <span class="smcapall">HE NEVER &#8220;SAT AROUND AND
MATCHED YARNS LIKE A COMMERCIAL
TRAVELLER?&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Is it any disgrace to sit around,
occasionally, and swap yarns, &#8220;like a
commercial traveller?&#8221;</p>

<p>If so, the men who are <span class="smcapall">TRULY RESPECTABLE</span>
are the dull fellows who can
neither tell a joke, nor enjoy one.
Some of the best and brightest men
that ever lived have prided themselves
upon their gifts in that very line. To
be a good story-teller is to possess the
golden key that unlocks almost every
social door.</p>

<p>Daniel Webster revelled in a good
story; so did Clay; so did Tom Corwin;
so did Robert Toombs, and Alexander
H. Stephens.</p>

<p>As a mental relaxation and recreation,
there are, in fact, few things
that serve better than &#8220;to sit around
and match yarns like a commercial
traveller.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The truth about Lincoln</span> is that
he was a man, and <i>a great man, but
no saint</i>.</p>

<p>The last time I was in New York
(November, 1905), my friend, Hon.
T. H. Tibbles, of Nebraska, was there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span>
also, and we talked of Lincoln, whom
Mr. Tibbles had known.</p>

<p>And <i>one of the very things which
Mr. Tibbles had seen and heard Mr.
Lincoln do was &#8220;to sit around and
match yarns like a commercial traveller.&#8221;</i></p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Tibbles told me</span> how, being at
a certain place, his attention was
attracted by repeated bursts of loud
laughter, coming from a certain room.
His youthful curiosity being excited,
he followed the sound to the room
from which it came. The sight that
met his eyes was this: Abraham
Lincoln was sitting in a chair, with
his big feet upon a table in front of
him; around him were grouped a
number of men, to whom Mr. Lincoln
was telling side-splitting yarns.</p>

<p>Tibbles joined the audience and got
his share of the fun.</p>

<p>What of it?</p>

<p>Does that lower Lincoln in any sensible
man&#8217;s eyes?</p>

<p>No. Let the Miss Nancy brigade
go off to one side and talk about the
nebular hypothesis, or some other
nice, well-bred subject. For my part,
I would prefer, <i>occasionally</i>, &#8220;to sit
around and match yarns like a commercial
traveller.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>I asked Mr. Tibbles whether the
stories that he heard Mr. Lincoln telling
were smutty.</p>

<p>At some future time, when I find,
after a careful field-glass scrutiny of
the horizon, that I have no other row
on hand, and am feeling the need of
one <i>very</i> badly, <i>I am going to tell you
Tibbles&#8217; answer</i>.</p>

<h3>Shoot, Luke, or Give Up the Gun.</h3>

<p>Most men are presumed to have
sense enough to know when the sun is
up, and when it is down.</p>

<p>To no mortal on this earth is it a
matter of vital importance to know
the exact moment it rises and sets.</p>

<p>Even if any inquisitive lunatic
wanted to know, he couldn&#8217;t find out,
for the simple reason that the hour
of sunrise and sunset varies with
every mile of the earth&#8217;s surface, and
is earlier to the man at the foot of
the mountain than to the man on top.</p>

<p>In the military establishments of the
world, however, it is considered to be
a matter of life and death to know
just when the sun rises and just when
he sets. So extremely indispensable is
this piece of daily information that a
gun, a cannon we mean, <i>must</i> be fired
to proclaim the tidings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boom!&#8221;&mdash;the sun is up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boom!&#8221;&mdash;he&#8217;s down.</p>

<p>Whereupon, your true soldier can
sleep with a conscience childlike in its
freedom from care.</p>

<p>Otherwise not.</p>

<p>If that gun (mind you, a <i>cannon</i>)
was <i>not</i> fired, solemnly and formally
fired, every time the sun rose and
every time he set, the military breast
would be racked with rude alarms,
and the military mind would be tossed
to and fro with dread forebodings.</p>

<p>To fire off a musket wouldn&#8217;t do;
wouldn&#8217;t <i>begin</i> to do.</p>

<p>It would be unconstitutional, if not
actually anarchistic and revolutionary.</p>

<p>To start the day without firing a
cannon&mdash;why the military establishment
could no more perform its traditionary
functions without a cannon
salute to the coming and going of the
sun than one of the old parties could
exist without stuffed ballot boxes.</p>

<p>Therefore, the custom is fixed&mdash;rooted,
as it were, in the soil of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page41">[41]</span>
civilization. It is one of the greatest
advantages we have over our untutored
ancestors.</p>

<p>However much <i>they</i> may have
yearned to shoot the sun up and shoot
it down, they couldn&#8217;t do it. They
had nothing to shoot with. They were
so completely engulfed in the currents
of stupidity and barbarism that they
just had to trust to their eyes to know
when the sun was up, or was down.</p>

<p>You might ask how the soldiers do
<i>on cloudy days</i>. You might ask, with
unseasonable levity, if the army
doesn&#8217;t have to go by the clock <i>when
the sun is not to be seen</i>. And you
might, out of your desire to be smart
and show yourself off, ask whether
the army couldn&#8217;t go by the clock as
well on fair days as on foul ones.</p>

<p>But such questions as these will do
you no good, and they would cause
you to lose friends. They are irrelevant
impertinences.</p>

<p>For, you see, when anything has
been done a long time, the presumption
is that there is sense in doing it
that way.</p>

<p>Therefore, all nice and respectable
people put salt in the fire when the
screech owl twitters, and make a cross
mark and spit in it, whenever they
turn back in their tracks. We all do
this because the custom has age and
good sense on its side.</p>

<p>If you think you can prance through
the world smashing steady old customs
which have been handed down
to us from time immemorial, you are
in a fair way to get yourself into
trouble.</p>

<p>Consequently, if you don&#8217;t like the
way the armies of the world spend the
people&#8217;s money shooting for the sun,
you had just as well make up your
mind to the wisdom of laying low,
and paying your share of the expenses.</p>

<p>Every two years, your chosen representatives
in Congress approve the
item in the Military Appropriation
Bill which gives $20,600 to the army
to shoot the sun-shoots with.</p>

<p>Now, if you don&#8217;t like it what are
you going to do about it?</p>

<p>The soldiers are not going to go by
clocks or by eyes&mdash;they are going to
shoot those cannon, at all the military
posts, every time the sun rises and
every time he sets.</p>

<p>And you will continue to pay the
expenses, as formerly.</p>

<p>What else are you here for?</p>

<p>&#8220;Boom!&#8221;&mdash;the sun&#8217;s up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boom!&#8221;&mdash;he&#8217;s down.</p>

<p>And it only costs $20,600.</p>

<p>See how great a thing it is to be
civilized.</p>

<p>We shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the
sun had lots of amusement watching
us fools down here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boom!!!</span></p>

<h3>The Dismissal of Those Negro Troops.</h3>

<p>What else could the President have
done?</p>

<p>He is Commander-in-Chief of the
Army: certain members of a certain
battalion &#8220;shoot up&#8221; a certain town
destroying property, terrorizing a
peaceful community and committing
murder.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief endeavors
to discover the identity of the guilty
parties. He fails. He then <i>appeals
to the honor of the battalion</i>, asking
that the innocent point out the guilty.
By no other method can the red-handed
rioters and murderers be
identified and brought to Justice.</p>

<p><i>The battalion is deaf to the appeal.</i></p>

<p>The innocent refuse to point out
the guilty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span></p>

<p><i>The innocent elect to make a common
cause with the guilty.</i></p>

<p>Therefore, <span class="smcapall">THEY, THEMSELVES, BECOME
GUILTY</span> of the highest crimes, as
<span class="smcap">Accessories after the Fact</span>.</p>

<p>In law and morals, there is <i>not an
innocent man left in that battalion</i>,
whose every member deliberately conceals
the murderers, aids and abets
them after full knowledge of the
crime.</p>

<p>Considering them all as guilty, the
President ordered their dishonorable
discharge.</p>

<p><i>Why not?</i></p>

<p>They had committed crimes involving
turpitude, degrading the uniform.</p>

<p>They had sullenly defied the President&#8217;s
appeal to their honor, and hence
his notice to disband them.</p>

<p>The innocent had elected to share
the guilt of the guilty, and thus <i>the
whole battalion was guilty</i>.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>Fanatical friends of the blacks say
that the President <i>should not have
punished the innocent</i>.</p>

<p>Nor did he.</p>

<p>He who conceals a murderer giving
him aid and comfort, is himself a
party to the crime.</p>

<p>What legal principle is older and
sounder than that?</p>

<p>The fanatics overlook it.</p>

<p>The President did not.</p>

<p>Nor will those who consider the
facts without passion and seek to
judge the case without prejudice.</p>

<p>Apparently, the fanatics intend to
convulse the Congress and the country
over this matter of the Negro Troops.</p>

<p>Let it not be forgotten that <i>even
now the fanatics do not propose that
the originally innocent negroes shall
be required to point out those originally
guilty</i>.</p>

<p>The fanatics demand that the
President back down, and that the
order for the dismissal of the negroes
be countermanded.</p>

<p>Thus, the originally guilty will be
forever screened, and the crimes they
committed will forever go unwhipt of
Justice.</p>

<p>The President has been right and
should be sustained.</p>

<p>To allow these fanatics and these
negroes to triumph over the President,
<span class="smcap">would be to exalt the criminal
and to degrade the Just Judge</span>.</p>

<p>If that had been a battalion of
white men, nothing would have been
said about it.</p>

<p>But it was a lot of negroes&mdash;consequently
the fanatics got busy.</p>

<h3>The Proposed Ship Subsidy</h3>

<p>A <span class="smcapall">FAT MAN</span> who was talking loud
enough to disturb his fellow-passengers
on the train, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What we need now is the Ship
Subsidy, and the Panama Canal and&#8221;&mdash;the
rest was of the same sort. He
had read something like this in a newspaper,
and had <span class="smcapall">SEEN IT THERE SO
OFTEN</span> that he had come to the conclusion
it must necessarily be true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In this way some men get what
they call their opinions.</span></p>

<p>Not <span class="smcapall">YOU</span>, of course. You get yours
<span class="smcapall">BY THINKING FOR YOURSELF</span>. <span class="smcap">I know</span>
that this is so, because <span class="smcapall">YOU TOLD ME
SO YOURSELF</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;We need a Ship Subsidy,&#8221; declared
the fat man, with emphasis and
decision. So &#8220;<span class="smcapall">WE</span>&#8221; do&mdash;but who are
the &#8220;<span class="smcapall">WE</span>?&#8221;</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapall">WE</span> who need a Ship Subsidy
are the Privileged, the beneficiaries
of Class Legislation, the Trusts which
gorge themselves upon unjust advantages.</p>

<p>In order that we may enable the<span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span>
Manufacturing Class <i>to enjoy a Monopoly
at home while they undersell
the foreign Manufacturer in the foreign
market</i>, we have put a fictitious,
<span class="smcapall">UNNATURAL VALUE TO THE MATERIALS
OUT OF WHICH SHIPS ARE BUILT</span>.</p>

<p>Consequently it costs <span class="smcapall">MORE</span> to build
a ship in the United States than anywhere
else in the world.</p>

<p>Now, our Navigation laws will not
allow the national flag to protect an
American vessel <span class="smcapall">UNLESS THAT VESSEL
IS BUILT IN THE UNITED STATES</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Result</span>:</p>

<p>The foreigner has come <span class="smcapall">WITH HIS
CHEAPER VESSEL</span> and borne off our
carrying trade.</p>

<p>Our infernal Tariff and Navigation
laws have driven our flag from the
seas, by making it <span class="smcapall">IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE
AMERICAN MERCHANT TO BUY HIS SHIP
ABROAD, OR TO BUILD ONE AT HOME ON
SUCH TERMS AS WILL ENABLE HIM TO
COMPETE WITH THE FOREIGN-BUILT
SHIP</span>.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t that plain enough, <span class="smcapall">WHEN YOU
STOP TO THINK IT OVER</span>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But the fat man</span> declared that
what <span class="smcapall">WE</span> need is the Ship Subsidy Bill.</p>

<p>What <span class="smcapall">IS</span> the Ship Subsidy Bill?</p>

<p>Why, it is a proposition that the
Government shall, in effect, take
money out of the National Treasury
<span class="smcapall">TO MAKE GOOD TO THE SEA MERCHANT
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FOREIGN
AND HOME PRICE OF THE SHIP</span>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the <span class="smcapall">GIST</span> of it, my son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At your expense</span>, the government
has created the Trust which makes it
<i>impossible for an American to build
a ship that can compete for ocean-going
freight</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At your expense</span>, that impossibility
is to be abolished. <span class="smcap">The difference
in price</span> between the cheap
foreign-built ship and the dear home-built
ship <span class="smcapall">IS TO BE MADE UP OUT OF
YOUR MONEY</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At your expense</span>, the Trust will
therefore be <span class="smcapall">ABLE TO COMPETE</span> for the
ocean business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At your expense</span>, the Trusts themselves
will scoop the Carriers&#8217; profit
upon the transportation of the Trust-made
goods which <span class="smcapall">ARE SOLD ABROAD
CHEAPER THAN THEY ARE SOLD AT
HOME</span>.</p>

<p>You catch it all around, don&#8217;t you,
son?</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yes, the fat man</span> was right.</p>

<p>We <span class="smcapall">DO</span> need a Ship Subsidy&mdash;we
Trusts.</p>

<p>We want to maintain our monopoly
at home, and we will do it. We want
to continue to undersell the foreigner
in the market and we will do
it. We want, furthermore, to rake into
our own coffers the profits now reaped
by the foreigner who controls ocean
transportation.</p>

<p>We <span class="smcapall">COULD</span> do this <i>by lowering the
Tariff</i>, but that would derange our
entire Class-law fabric. <span class="smcap">That would
endanger our monopoly of the
home market.</span></p>

<p>Consequently, the only way for us
to get what <span class="smcapall">WE</span> want, is to have the
Government grant us a Subsidy which
will make good to us <span class="smcapall">THAT DIFFERENCE
IN PRICE</span> between home-made and foreign-made
vessels <span class="smcapall">WHICH OUR TRUST-CREATING
TARIFF HAS CAUSED</span>.</p>

<p>Thus we, the Privileged, will unload
upon the Unprivileged <span class="smcapall">BOTH LOADS</span>,&mdash;that
of the Trust, and that of <span class="smcapall">OUR</span>
escape from <span class="smcapall">THE ONE CONSEQUENCE</span> of
the trust <span class="smcapall">WHICH HURTS US</span>.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There is only one</span> incident to the
Protective system which is a drawback
to the Trusts.</p>

<p>That is <span class="smcapall">THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF CONTROLLING
OCEAN TRANSPORTATION</span>.</p>

<p>Every <span class="smcapall">OTHER</span> incident to the Protective
System <span class="smcapall">HELPS THE TRUSTS AND
HURTS THE PEOPLE</span>.</p>

<p>The one incident which <span class="smcapall">HURTS THE
TRUSTS AND HELPS THE PEOPLE</span> must
be dealt with.</p>

<p>We must so manage that ocean
transportation shall likewise belong to
the Trusts.</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By giving to the merchant marine
a sum of money out of the
public treasury, over and above the
freight which is earned.</span></p>

<p>Then, indeed, every incident of the
Protective System will present a harmonious
color-scheme, for <span class="smcapall">THE TRUSTS
WILL HAVE HOGGED THE WHOLE BUSINESS</span>.</p>

<p>And that donation out of your tax
money, which is intended to save the
Trusts from the injurious burden of
their own damnable Tariff System is
the Ship Subsidy which the fat man
said we need.</p>

<p>So long as the Protective System
hurts the Common People it is a national
blessing and must be gratefully
sustained: <i>but the moment the same</i>
system pinches the Protected Interests,
they must <i>rob you</i> under the
form of Ship Subsidy to get back
what they lose by their own tariff.</p>

<h3>An Appeal to Patriotism.</h3>

<p>Signs are plentiful that tens of
thousands of honest Democrats and
Republicans are profoundly dissatisfied
with the trend of recent events.</p>

<p>We look to the State, and no beacon
light gives us confidence.</p>

<p>The time was when our rulers loved
the people, trusted the people, worked
for the people. Those were the times
when there was light on the hearth,
plenty on the board, and hope in the
hearts of the people.</p>

<p>Those were the times when our rulers
<i>remembered that our forefathers came
here to build a temple, a government</i>,
<span class="smcap">differing in all vital respects
from the hateful systems of the
Old World</span>.</p>

<p>For this very purpose&mdash;that of
establishing a system entirely different
from that of Europe&mdash;our forefathers
braved the perils of the deep; fought
hunger and faced death; battled with
the wilderness and the savages it held;
determined to die free, rather than
live slaves.</p>

<p>In Europe they were fettered by
class laws, class privileges, class tyrannies.</p>

<p>They were crowded out from a fair
competition for a share of nature&#8217;s
bounties by monopolies, chartered
wrongs, statutory abuses, legalized
spoliations.</p>

<p>Braver than we, their degenerate
sons, they counted life worth nothing
unless freedom went with it, and
<span class="smcap">their coming here was a sublime
protest against the Old World system
of Class-law and special privilege</span>.</p>

<p>What have we, today, <i>as the result
of all their heroism, and suffering and
success</i>?</p>

<p>We have our rulers aping everything
Europe does, and fitting upon
us, forever, the abominable system our
forefathers fled to escape.</p>

<p><i>Where are class laws more insolently
dominant than here?</i></p>

<p>Where is Special Privilege more
tyranically exacting than here?</p>

<p>Where are monopolies more contemptuous
of law and public welfare
than here?</p>

<p>What people are greater slaves to
misgovernment than you whose low-priced
products must bear the strain
of untaxed bonds, useless offices, and
a steady growth of ever increasing
salaries?</p>

<p>Who pay <i>nine-tenths of all the
taxes</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The many who toil.</span></p>

<p>Who gets <i>the lion&#8217;s share of all the
wealth produced</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The few who do not toil.</span></p>

<p>In what country do the laborers, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span>
shop and mine and mill and field,
produce more of the good things of
life than ours?</p>

<p>It cannot be named.</p>

<p>In what country has nature opened
her royal hands with a more regal
bounty?</p>

<p>It cannot be named.</p>

<p>Has there been any failure of harvest?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Has there been pestilence, invasion,
or civil strife?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Then why is it that the signal guns
of distress sound all along the commercial
seas, telling of brave ships
going down?</p>

<p>Why is it that the feet of the homeless
and the unemployed beat the
pavements of our great cities with a
never-ending march?</p>

<p>Oh, brothers! why are so many
hearths chill and dark, so many hungry
mouths unfed, so many despairing
souls weighed down with the
nameless dread of the unknown
future?</p>

<p>We have left the beaten track of
our fathers. We have let the old landmarks
be forgotten. We have gone
after strange gods.</p>

<p>We have foresworn the faith upon
which our republic was founded, and
are being led back to the system our
ancestors came here to shun. Why
can&#8217;t we all see it? Why can&#8217;t we all
act together? Why can&#8217;t we lay down
prejudice, pride and passion, and
devote our noblest efforts to the salvation
of our country?</p>

<p>Would that some divine touch of
duty could lift us all to the summits
of patriotism where the only rivalry
would be that of service&mdash;the only
purpose that of redeeming the land
from those who despoil it.</p>

<p>Call the party what you please&mdash;names

equal and exact justice to all men,

Hearst&#8217;s New York campaign, he&#8217;s
as much of what he <i>once was</i> as he
<i>ever</i> was&mdash;if not more.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>That brightest and best of newspapers,
the <i>Washington Post</i>, suggests
that some Frenchman snuff out the
wretched little cad, libertine, and
aristocratic brute, Boni Castellane.</p>

<p>Granting that the snuffing out suggestion
is a good one, why should a
<i>Frenchman</i> be asked to shoot the contemptible
and loathsome creature?</p>

<p>The American lady whose money he
squandered, whose jaws he slapped,
and whose life he wrecked, has <i>three
able-bodied brothers</i>&mdash;why should the
Gould brothers <i>wait for a Frenchman</i>
to take hold of the snuffing out job?</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>Joseph H. Choate, being asked to
define the difference between Cleveland
and Roosevelt, answered, &#8220;Mr.
Cleveland is too lazy to hunt and Mr.
Roosevelt is too restless to fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>But see what a happy middle-course
Mr. Bryan takes. When too restless
to fish, he hunts; and when too lazy
to hunt, he catches fish. In other
words, you <i>never can put your eye
on him when he isn&#8217;t after it</i>.</p>

<p>The Moguls of High Finance have
about worked out their plans for an
elastic currency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span></p>

<p>Their own notes are to be used as
money, and the only thing back of
the notes will be &#8220;the general credit
of the Banks.&#8221;</p>

<p>How pleasant it is to witness the
process by which national finance
simplifies itself and acquires that suppleness
of joint which the Moguls call
&#8220;elasticity.&#8221;</p>

<p>A Money system which rests upon
a bottle of ink, a quire of paper, and a
printing press is <i>so</i> simple that even
a wayfaring fool may comprehend it.</p>

<p>And when it comes to pass that
<i>any</i> Mogul of Finance can turn himself,
in the twinkle of an eye, into a
Paper-money Mill, our currency will
be &#8220;elastic&#8221; to beat the band.</p>

<p>Go it, Moguls!</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>The brilliant paragrapher of the
<i>Atlanta Journal</i> writes:</p>

<p>&#8220;The only thing lacking about the
dismissal of those negro troops was
that they should have been disbanded
in Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inasmuch as nearly all of &#8220;those
negro troops&#8221; will be given permission
to re-enlist, it isn&#8217;t clear to my
mind that Boston couldn&#8217;t have
enjoyed the episode quite as much as
any other city&mdash;Atlanta, for instance.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>The same paragrapher who <i>is</i> really
one of the brightest of the bunch,
remarks:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stonewall Jackson once declared
that &#8216;nothing justifies profanity.&#8217;
But then he never tried being Speaker
of the House.&#8221;</p>

<p>While we are at it, let&#8217;s put the case
stronger than <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s being Speaker of the House
to living in a town like Thomson,
whose name the outside world spells
in seven different ways?</p>

<p>What&#8217;s being Speaker of the House
to having a fat knave and a lean sneak
doing business <i>under your name</i> in
such a den as Town Topics?</p>

<p>What&#8217;s being Speaker of the House
to having the fat knave and the lean
sneak virtually tell the world, <i>in a
magazine bearing your name</i>, that you
are wealthy and <i>therefore</i> could
afford to work <i>for them</i> for nothing?</p>

<p>What&#8217;s being Speaker of the House
to having your own friends invited,
<i>by the Secretary of your National
Committee</i>, to come round to the <span class="smcapall">SIDE
DOOR</span> of the Town Topics den, and
drop ten dollars, each, into the Mann-hole?</p>

<p>Dear me! When it comes to claiming
credit for <i>not</i> cussing, I could
name several things that dwarf the
proportions of the Speakership of the
House.</p>

<p>Mr. Roosevelt went down to Panama
to take a look at that big ditch which
nobody seems to be digging very fast.
Thus far the trench appears to be just
large enough to hold the millions of
dollars that the taxpayers are pouring
into it.</p>

<p>While he was down there it is to be
hoped that Mr. Roosevelt gave close
scrutiny to the place where the administration
of Jules Grevy, President of
the Republic of France, slid into that
same ditch. By marking the place,
carefully, Mr. Roosevelt may possibly
prevent his own administration from
tumbling into the same hole.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>They are raising a rumpus in Government
circles because the liquor
dealers are bottling whiskey in bottles&mdash;bearing
the official stamp&mdash;that do
not contain full measure.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t much matter. The less
whiskey the bottle holds the better for
the man who holds the bottle.</p>

<h3>After All It Depends Upon Who Owns the Ox</h3>

<p>On the Pacific Coast there is an
intense hostility to the yellow man.</p>

<p>The whites are at daggers&#8217; point
with Chinamen and Japanese.</p>

<p>Race hatred, you see.</p>

<p>Recently, the authorities of San
Francisco have separated the two
races in the schools.</p>

<p>Jap. children are not allowed in the
white schools. Yellow must not mix
with white. Contact is contaminating.
Separate class-rooms, separate
play-grounds, separate everything&mdash;so
runs the educational order of the
day.</p>

<p>Yet those white people of the
Pacific Coast pretend that they cannot
understand the attitude of the Southern
whites to the negro.</p>

<p>It is all right for <span class="smcapall">THEM</span> to cultivate
race-hatred of the <i>yellow</i> man, but
all wrong for <span class="smcapall">US</span> to indulge race-hatred
of the <i>black</i> man.</p>

<p>Queer kettle of fish, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<h2>A Survey of the World.</h2>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="author">BY CHARLES J. BAYNE.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The close of the old year and the
beginning of the new finds the civilized
world in a state of parliamentary
deliberation, with the establishment
of additional parliaments in various
dependencies as one of the leading
subjects of deliberation. The
lawmakers of practically every nation
in the two hemispheres are now in
session, so the discussion of budgets
and the agitation of reforms furnish
ever-changing subjects of public
interest.</p>

<p>The American mind has been moving
forward from its varied and conflicting
analyses of the recent elections
to the concrete measures which
will be introduced in Congress, and
still it is unable to fix its attention
definitely on serious subjects while the
holiday spirit is in the air. Members
of Congress themselves feel that they
are merely in Washington for a few
days to outline a program for a later
date.</p>

<div class="figright nomargin w300">
<img src="images/illo051.jpg" alt="Roosevelt" width="300" height="385" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize90">New York <i>Globe</i></span><br />
&#8220;NOW TO BUSINESS.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<h3 class="survey">The President&#8217;s Message.</h3>

<p>Congress convened on the first
Monday in December, and on the following
day the President&#8217;s message
was transmitted to that body. It is
generally agreed that Mr. Roosevelt&#8217;s
communications to the federal law-makers
are increasingly partaking of
the nature of open letters to the
American people rather than being
definite suggestions to the House and
Senate of the measures which should
be enacted at the current session into
law. The present document is no
exception to that rule. It is largely
made up of homilies which recall
the waggish comment of Tom Reed
about &#8220;Roosevelt&#8217;s delightful enthusiasm
over his discovery of the Ten
Commandments.&#8221; Such is practically
the view of The Washington
<i>Herald</i>, for instance, which says that
&#8220;Congress will regard the counsels
of the President as the obiter dicta
of a distinguished publicist, awakening
the public conscience, but without
special bearing on the work of the
present session.&#8221;</p>

<p>The forces of reform were delighted
to find him advocating a law
prohibiting corporations from contributing<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
to campaign funds, the failure
to pass which during the first
session of the present Congress, when
reform was in the air, was the subject
of considerable criticism. It is
pointed out that he does not now go so
far as to advise that all contributions
shall be made public. He is quoted,
since the transmission of his message,
as favoring a return to the large insurance
companies of the funds they contributed
to the last Republican campaign,
and this has brought forth the
question from his critics: Why disgorge
only the contributions of the
insurance companies, when the funds
belonging to stock-holders, as well as
to policy-holders, have been used by
various corporations to influence
elections?</p>

<h3 class="survey">The Race Question.</h3>

<p>One of those homilies to which
reference has been made is the President&#8217;s
discussion of lynching and the
race question. No one will take issue
with him on what he says on the subject&mdash;unless
it be on the statement
that two thirds of the lynchings are
for crimes other than rape. He quotes
Ex-Gov. Candler as saying that he
had, within one month, saved a dozen
innocent negroes from lynching.
After still further discussion of the
question, the President advocates the
infliction of the death penalty for
rape and urges that assault with
intent to commit this crime be made
a capital offense, &#8220;at least in the discretion
of the court.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this is, of course, a matter with
which the states alone can deal, except
in the territories under the exclusive
jurisdiction of the federal government.
On the general subject of
lynching, The Brooklyn <i>Eagle</i> says
that &#8220;the President is right in his
preachment, but would be tempted to
ignore it if he were in private life,
and a citizen of a Southern state.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="survey">Labor Legislation.</h3>

<p>The relations of labor and capital
come in for considerable discussion,
and the cause of labor is well sustained.
The President advocates a
rigid enforcement of the eight-hour
law, where practicable, a conservative
use of injunctions, and an investigation
of the conditions of the labor of
children and women.</p>

<p>Senator Beveridge is already
primed with a bill which will reach
the child labor question, through the
elastic Interstate Commerce Commission,
by prohibiting the interstate
transportation of commodities on
which child labor has been employed.</p>

<p>The President favors the enlargement
of the Employers&#8217; Liability bill,
passed at the last session of Congress,
so as to place the &#8220;entire risk of the
trade&#8221; upon the employer, and he
favors federal investigation of controversies
between labor and capital.</p>

<p>He advocates an enlargement of
the meat inspection bill, so as to provide
for placing the date of inspection
on the label and throwing the cost
of inspection on the packers.</p>

<p>He urges the more complete control
of corporations in general, &#8220;by a national
license law, or in other fashion,&#8221;
which is one of the utterances anticipated
with the keenest interest.</p>

<div class="figleft nomargin w380">
<img src="images/illo052.jpg" alt="Cartoon" width="380" height="374" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize90">Washington <i>Post</i></span><br />
TEDDY&#8217;S ONLY TARIFF REFORM.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span></p>

<p>He comes out for an inheritance
tax, an income tax, and mildly urges
a ship subsidy and currency reform.</p>

<p>A bill providing for free trade
with the Philippines passed the
House in the last session, but it met
its death in the Senate at the hands
of members who feared that it would
seriously affect the beet sugar industry.
The President again recommends
the adoption of this measure, or at
least a reduction in the Philippine
tariff; and, as one result of his visit
to Porto Rico, he asks that the inhabitants
be granted United States citizenship.
A special message on this
subject, it is said, will go to Congress
later.</p>

<h3 class="survey">The Japanese Question.</h3>

<p>His utterances on the Japanese
question are perhaps the most sensational
in the entire document. At
least they have proven so, from two
points of view. After paying a
splendid tribute to the &#8220;little brown
men&#8221; of the Orient, and advocating
the adoption of naturalization laws in
their behalf, he makes an attack upon
the principle of state rights which has
attracted more than ordinary attention.
The exclusion of Japanese
children from the public schools of
San Francisco, which is discussed
more at length elsewhere, has occupied
a foremost place in the public
mind for some time, and it is generally
conceded to have largely
resolved itself into a question of
state rights, and the power of the
federal government to force an observance
of international treaties on the
individual states, particularly where
state laws alone are involved. The
President demands that the civil and
criminal laws of the federal government
be so amended as to &#8220;enable the
President to enforce the rights of
aliens under treaties.&#8221;</p>

<p>Further along he made some nebulous
threats about employing all the
force of the army and navy in behalf
of the Japanese, if necessary, and at
once the California representatives
were, themselves, up in arms. The
President hastened to explain that he
had been misunderstood&mdash;that he only
meant to say that he would protect
the Japanese from mob violence, by
aid of the army and navy, if necessary,
so the members from the Pacific
slope are satisfied.</p>

<p>In the meantime the President has
instructed the department of justice
in California to make a test case of
the state law segregating &#8220;the children
of Mongolian parentage&#8221; from
the whites in public schools, and it is
believed that the matter will thus be
settled.</p>

<p>The remainder of the message is
devoted to the Rio conference, the
situation in Cuba, Central America
and Alaska, the maintenance of the
navy at its present efficiency, and the
approaching session of the second
peace conference at the Hague.</p>

<h3 class="survey">Mr. Watson&#8217;s Views.</h3>

<p>While various public men have
selected a variety of sentences from
the Presidential Message as being particularly
striking, our readers may
have a natural curiosity to know what
sentence in the message of the President
most impressed our Editor-in-Chief.
His section of the Magazine
had been closed before the President&#8217;s
message was made public, but
in a private letter to me, Mr. Watson
remarks that the finest sentence to be
found in Mr. Roosevelt&#8217;s recent message
to Congress, is this:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Neither a nation, nor an individual,
can surrender conscience to
another&#8217;s keeping. A just war is far
better for the soul of a nation than
the most prosperous peace obtained
by acquiescence to any wrong or injustice.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Watson thinks that the manner
in which the President emphasizes the
fact that a nation, like an individual,<span class="pagenum" id="Page54">[54]</span>
<i>should not consent to live</i> under dishonorable
conditions, was very fine.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>In addition to the editorial expressions
which have been incidentally
quoted in the foregoing summary of
the message, The New York <i>World</i>
says that &#8220;if Roosevelt would advocate
tariff reform and if Mr. Bryan
would stop advocating government
ownership of railroads, they would be
substantially in accord.&#8221; The New
York <i>Tribune</i> says &#8220;the message is
characterized throughout by that
courage with which the President
habitually faces public questions.&#8221;
The New York <i>Press</i> thinks the reading
of it must have given the trust-owners
&#8220;a night of restless slumbers.&#8221;
The New York <i>American</i>
calls it &#8220;the most ambitious state
paper of his career.&#8221; The New York
<i>Times</i> thinks the wisest counsel the
President gives Congress is to &#8220;obviate
the evil of prohibiting all combinations
of capital, whether good or
bad.&#8221; The New York <i>Sun</i> devotes its
criticisms chiefly to those matters
affecting the judiciary.</p>

<h3 class="survey">Cabinet Changes.</h3>

<p>The echoes of the Presidential
message had scarcely died away, when
the President communicated to the
Senate a long list of nominations
which included many changes in his
Cabinet. Root, Taft and Wilson will
remain where they are. Charles
Jerome Bonaparte, will become Attorney
General; Secretary Victor H.
Metcalf, Secretary of the Navy;
Oscar S. Straus, of New York, Secretary
of Commerce and Labor; George
B. Cortelyou, Secretary of the Treasury,
in place of Leslie M. Shaw, who
is to resign, and Mr. Cortelyou
will be succeeded in the Post Office by
Mr. George V. L. Meyer; James R.
Garfield, Secretary of the Interior.</p>

<p>The appointment of Attorney General
Moody to a position on the
Supreme Court Bench has brought
forth considerable criticism. Before
him, in that capacity, must come for
review much of the litigation in which
he, as prosecuting attorney for the
government, has been interested.
Nearly forty million dollars in various
suits are being held up for a hearing
before a full bench. According to
established precedent, Mr. Moody
should not pass upon them, after having
been identified with them in the
Department of Justice. No definite
opposition to his confirmation is
manifested, however.</p>

<h3 class="survey">The General Elections.</h3>

<p>The general elections are receding
farther and farther into the past, and
public interest in the matter is abating.
The returns in the state of New
York, showing the election of the
entire Democratic ticket with the
exception of the head, have been
interpreted according to the personal
views of the interpreters, but the
truth seems to be that there was a general
uprising in favor of reform,
brought largely to the forefront by
Hearst, but that the personality of
Hearst himself, coupled with his adhesion
to Boss Murphy, was something
that the people would not stand for,
and hence his defeat. Representative
Jas. W. Wadsworth paid the penalty
of his opposition to the meat inspection
bill, and will not be in the Sixtieth
Congress.</p>

<p>A survey of the elections as a whole
shows that the Republican majority
in the Sixtieth Congress will drop
from 112 to 58. The Republicans carried
every Northern state by reduced
majorities, and the Democrats carried
every Southern state, in many instances
by increased majorities, at the
same time redeeming Missouri from
the Republican ranks into which she
passed for the first time with the
Roosevelt tidal wave. In the lower
house of the Sixtieth Congress there
will be an even hundred new members.</p>

<p>The Republicans of the Senate, will
probably make a gain of four members.
The terms of thirty senators
will expire on March 4, 1907, fifteen
of them being Democrats and fifteen
Republicans. Patterson, of Colorado,
Guerin, of Oregon&mdash;appointed to succeed
the late Senator Mitchell, who
died in disgrace&mdash;Dubois, of Idaho,
and Clark, of Montana, are the four
Democrats who will probably be succeeded
by Republicans. Then the
Republicans in the Senate will have
more than a two-thirds majority.</p>

Edwin S. Stuart&mdash;the first bachelor

to be &#8220;a very nice man,&#8221; so
the Republicans elected him over the

charged in some quarters that his
election indicates that Pennsylvania
has recovered from her spasm of<span class="pagenum" id="Page56">[56]</span>

<h3 class="survey">The Divorce Congress.</h3>

<p>One of the notable conventions of
the year was that of the National
Divorce Congress which assembled in
Philadelphia on Nov. 19 and 20 for
the purpose of formulating a uniform
divorce law which, it is hoped, would
be enacted by all the states of the
Union. It was the legislature of
Pennsylvania which took the initiative
in this matter, not only by codifying
and examining its own laws, but
by arranging a conference, through
Governor Pennypacker, to discuss the
matter of uniform divorce laws. This
conference was held in Washington
last February and a committee was
appointed to draw up a model bill to
present to all the states. Thirty states
and territories were represented at the
Congress in Philadelphia and the
grounds for absolute divorce, as presented
by the committee and adopted
by the Congress were:</p>

<p>1. Adultery.</p>

<p>2. Bigamy, at the suit of the innocent
and injured party to the first
marriage.</p>

<p>3. Conviction and sentence for
crime, followed by continuous imprisonment
for at least two years, or
under indeterminate sentence for at
least one year.</p>

<p>4. Extreme cruelty, endangering
life or health.</p>

<p>5. Wilful desertion for two years.</p>

<p>6. Habitual drunkenness for two
years.</p>

<h3 class="survey">The Situation in &#8217;Frisco.</h3>

<p>About the least pacific section of
our united country just at present is
the Pacific slope. The action of the
Board of Education of San Francisco
in excluding Japanese children
from the regular public schools of
the city, and requiring that they be
segregated in schools set aside exclusively
for them, has aroused the deepest
interest all over the country, and
its echoes are reverberating on the
shores of the Chrysanthemum kingdom.
It is becoming increasingly
evident that the matter of excluding
the Japanese from the public schools
is not the crux of the matter. It is
but a symptom of a very general condition
of dislike and distrust. The
people of California frankly declare
that the more they see of the Japanese
the less they like them and that
since the Russo-Japanese war, as one
resident of the state puts it, &#8220;the
Japs are getting too blamed cockey.&#8221;
The Californians assert that they
have the sympathy and support of the
entire Pacific slope in their determination
to hold the Japanese in check.
They point to the fact that the little
brown men practically dominate the
labor situation in Hawaii, and that
they are making that territory merely
a half-way house to California, which
they will likewise over-run. The
labor unions, which are particularly
strong on the slope are strong in their
antagonism to the Japanese.</p>

<p>It is boldly declared by many representative
citizens of California that
they will not stop short of introducing
a bill in this or the Sixtieth Congress
excluding the Japanese from
the United States on practically the
same terms as are now applied to the
Chinese, who are held in some quarters
to be more desirable.</p>

<p>Many interesting questions of national
and international law are involved
in the present situation.</p>

<p>Those who advocate a federal law
excluding the Japanese are reminded
that the existing treaty, which was
negotiated by Mr. Gresham in Mr.
Cleveland&#8217;s second administration,
provides that &#8220;this treaty shall go
into operation on the 17th day of
July, 1899 and shall remain in force
for a period of twelve years from that
date.&#8221; Twelve months&#8217; notice, from
the time of expiration, must also be
given by either party, if such party
desires to terminate the agreement.
Notice of termination cannot be given,<span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span>
therefore, until July 19, 1911, and
until July 1912, it must continue as
the supreme law of the land. Consequently
the adoption of a Japanese
exclusion law cannot become effective
for five years and a half. The
President&#8217;s advocacy of naturalization
for the Japanese is not received
kindly on the slope. In addition to all
this Mayor Schmitz and Abe Ruef,
the political &#8220;boss,&#8221; have been
indicted for extortion.</p>

<h3 class="survey">The Increase in Wages.</h3>

<p>The month of November was
marked by the announcement of the
most general increase in the wages of
employes ever recorded in this country
during so short a period. This
increase was made, for the most part,
by the railroads and other large corporate
interests and chiefly affects
employes whose salaries are less than
$200 a month. In many instances the
advance began with the first of December,
while in others it becomes effective
with the new year.</p>

<p>It would be a difficult matter to
make anything like an approximate
estimate of this golden harvest which
is to go into the pockets of the laboring
men. It is said by those who are
in a position to know, that the advance
in wages announced by the railroads
during the month of November
would alone amount to $20,000,000
annually, affecting 200,000 employes.
Even so conservative an authority as
The Chicago <i>Evening Post</i> thinks it
entirely probable that the advance in
the wages of railroad employes
becoming effective on the first of
the year will reach something like
$100,000,000 a year, while others place
it still higher. The Steel Trust and
the street railroads have also
advanced wages.</p>

<div class="figright nomargin w300">
<img src="images/illo058b.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="336" />
<p class="caption">EDWARD H. HARRIMAN.</p>
</div>

<p>It is only fair to say, in dwelling
upon this general advance in the
wages of labor in so many departments
of industry, that, according to the
mercantile agencies, the cost of living
is higher now than it has been at any
time in twenty years, and the continuance
of agitation and discontent
in certain quarters is held to be
justifiable for the reason that the purchasing
power of a dollar is so much
less than formerly that it is no more
than off-set by an increase of ten per
cent in wages.</p>

<h3 class="survey">The Harriman-Fish Embroglio.</h3>

<p>The final triumph of Edward H.
Harriman over President Stuyvesant
Fish, of the Illinois Central, after a
long and bitter feud extending over<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
many years, is still a topic of absorbing
interest in the railroad world and
to the public in general. At a special
meeting of the directors of the road
held in New York early in November
Mr. Fish was defeated for re-election
by a vote of eight to four, the thirteenth
director, Vice-President Welling,
being confined to his bed from an
illness of which he died a few days
later. The formal complaint made
against President Fish was that he
had not observed the &#8220;harmony&#8221;
agreement of last July, when it was
at one time proposed that a special
committee should solicit proxies, and
not Mr. Fish personally. He was
charged with arrogating to himself
alone &#8220;the duty and function resting
upon the entire board,&#8221; and not being
able to &#8220;distinguish between the
powers and duties of the president
and those of the directors of the corporation.&#8221;
The purpose of the board
was known before-hand and it was no
surprise when James T. Harahan, one
of the vice-presidents, was chosen to
succeed Mr. Fish.</p>

<p>The nomination was seconded by
Charles A. Peabody, President of the
Mutual Life Insurance Company,
which was one of the many reasons
sustaining the belief on the part of
Mr. Fish&#8217;s friends that his refusal to
take part in the &#8220;white-washing&#8221; of
the Mutual officials was really responsible
for his overthrow. It is recalled
that Harriman made threats at the
time that he would make reprisal on
Fish for his refusal to knuckle under.</p>

<div class="figleft nomargin w300">
<img src="images/illo059.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="299" />
<p class="caption">STUYVESANT FISH.</p>
</div>

<p>In the meantime Mr. Fish announced
his intention of carrying the
matter into the courts. The constitution
of the state of Illinois provides
that &#8220;no railroad corporation shall
consolidate its stock, property or franchises
with any other railroad corporation
owning a parallel or competing
line. A majority of the directors of
any railroad corporation now incorporated,
or hereafter to be incorporated
by the laws of this state, shall
be citizens and residents of this
state.&#8221; Of the directors of the
Illinois Central only three, at the
time of the recent election, were residents
of the state of Illinois. They
were Gov. Deneen, who is an ex-officio
director by reason of his office as governor,
James T. Harahan, the new
president, and John C. Welling, who
has since died. It is not denied that
for thirteen years a majority of the
directors have not been &#8220;citizens and
residents of Illinois,&#8221; and the scope
of the immediate issue is enlarged by
the fact that if the courts hold the
present board to be illegal, so also will
be the work of every board for the
past thirteen years, including issues
of stocks, bonds, etc.</p>

<p>Harriman&#8217;s control of so vast a
system of railroads is naturally
regarded as a menace. The Union
Pacific and the Southern Pacific, of
which he is absolute master, aggregate
15,000 miles, with an outstanding
capitalization of $1,031,000,000. The
Chicago &amp; Alton and the Illinois
Central, which he practically controls,
have a mileage of 6,668, with a capitalization
of over $380,728,223. He is
largely in control of the Baltimore &amp;
Ohio, the Reading and the Central of
New Jersey railroads, with a mileage
of 7,255 and a capitalization of practically
$770,000,000. He is a stockholder
and director in Erie, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
has a mileage of 2,553 and a capitalization
of $382,900,000. Thus he
is a moving spirit and to a large
extent the dominant figure in 31,000
miles of railroad, with a capitalization
of more than two billions and a half
of dollars. It is not surprising that
an investigation on the part of the
Interstate Commerce Commission is
now announced.</p>

<h3 class="survey">Ryan&#8217;s Vast Interests.</h3>

<p>One of the recent surprises in Wall
street was the resignation of Thomas
F. Ryan as a director from more than
twenty railroads and industrial corporations,
including the leading trusts
of the country. Coincident with his
retirement came the announcement
that he was one of a number of American
capitalists who had secured from
King Leopold of Belgium certain
rights in 8,400,000 acres of land in
the Congo Free State, for the purpose
of developing the rubber and mineral
resources, building railroads and
otherwise exploiting that vast territory.</p>

<p>An effort is being made in Congress
to have this government join in an
investigation of conditions in the
Congo and several of Leopold&#8217;s lobbyists
are in hot water.</p>

<h3 class="survey">The Lesson of Spencer&#8217;s Death.</h3>

<p>No event in recent years has
created a more profound sensation
than the tragic death of President
Samuel Spencer, of the Southern railroad,
who was killed in a rear-end collision
on his own road on the morning
of Thanksgiving day. Mr. Spencer
was a native Georgian, and worked
his way through all the grades of his
calling to the presidency he held at
the time of his death. Many personal
tributes have been paid to Mr. Spencer,
but the fact that he was a victim
to the inefficiency of his own railroad
system has been commented upon with
decided emphasis. Readers of <span class="smcap">The
Jeffersonian Magazine</span> will recall
the heated controversy last summer
between Mr. Watson and the editor of
The Macon <i>Telegraph</i>. The latter
criticised Mr. Watson for making the
point that Mr. Spencer, as a railroad
manager, squeezed too much money
out of the South into the pockets of
Wall street millionaires, allowing his
road to become dangerous, allowing
employes to be overworked, allowing
bridges to become decayed, refusing
to double-track where double tracking
was needed and refusing to employ a
sufficient number of men to do the
amount of work necessary in the
proper operation of the property. The
text from which Mr. Watson preached
was the official commendation of Mr.
Spencer by the voting trustees of the
Southern Railway Holding Company.
They praised him because he had, during
the last thirteen years, doubled
their property, trebled the gross earnings,
and increased the net earnings,
over and above all operating expenses,
more than 525 per cent. He took this
report and proved that instead of
being something for Mr. Spencer to be
proud of, it was something to make
him ashamed, since it proved conclusively
that the road was being run
simply from the standpoint of those
who wanted dividends and who did
not care how unsatisfactory was the
service, nor how many lives were lost
because of the failure to adopt safety
appliances, double tracks, and by failure
to abolish the deadly grade crossings.
Mr. Watson feels that the fate
which has overtaken Mr. Spencer is
the most appalling proof that could be
furnished that he was right in his contentions.</p>

<p>The press of this country and England
view the matter in the same light.
The Brooklyn <i>Eagle</i>, in discussing the
matter, says, &#8220;We can only deplore
this very able man&#8217;s loss. We can
only hope that his sacrifice may result
in no further disregard of the precautions
that would have averted it,
had those precautions been observed.
Until that time,&#8221; continues the <i>Eagle</i>,
&#8220;we may expect preventable &#8216;accidents&#8217;
which wear every quality of
murder except its intent.&#8221; <i>The Pall
Mall Gazette</i>, of London, founded by
W. T. Stead, expresses the hope that
Mr. Spencer&#8217;s death &#8220;will arouse
those responsible for the management
of American railroads to a feeling
that it is desirable to make them
safer.&#8221; The statistics of accidental
deaths in America, says <i>The Gazette</i>,
&#8220;are appalling to the English mind,

<h3 class="survey">Standard Oil Before the Bar.</h3>

<p>The most definite and concrete
form which the agitation against
trusts and combines has ever assumed
in this country, and the most interesting
legal step the government has
taken in a generation, was the filing
of a bill in equity, by United States
Attorney General Moody, on Nov. 15,
in the Eighth Judicial Circuit, in St.
Louis, Mo., against the Standard Oil
Company, of New Jersey, and seventy
of its subsidiary corporations and
limited partnerships, as well as against
seven of the leading officers and directors
of the big trust, to have the combination
dissolved under the Sherman
Anti-Trust law, as being in restraint
of trade and commerce. The government,
for nearly two years, has been
gathering information on which to
base some such action. But last June
the attorney general appointed two
assistants, Messrs. F. B. Kellogg and
C. B. Morrison, to act with Assistant
Attorney General Purdy in gathering
information as to the transgressions
of the Oil Trust in the business of
refining, transporting, distributing
and selling oil throughout the United
States.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600">
<img src="images/illo063.jpg" alt="Cartoon" width="600" height="556" />
<p class="caption">THE STRIPES MAY GO ON YET, IF YOU DON&#8217;T WATCH OUT.</p>
</div>

<p>Their report was such as to justify
legal action on the part of the Department
of Justice, and after the information
had been carefully examined<span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span>
by the President and the Cabinet, the
bill in equity was filed. The recital of
alleged facts in this petition, is virtually
a history of the Standard Oil
Company from its infancy to the present
time. It sets forth that the Standard
Oil Company, of New Jersey, with
its seventy allied corporations and
limited partnerships, produces, transports
and sells about 90 per cent of
the refined oil products used in this
country and about the same proportion
of the refined oil exported from
the United States; that this practical
monopoly has been procured by a
course of action which, beginning in
1870, has continued, in the main,
under the same persons down to the
present time; that these persons now
surviving are John D. Rockefeller.
William Rockefeller, Henry H.
Rogers, Henry M. Flagler, John A.
Archbold, Oliver H. Payne and Chas.
M. Pratt; that their design throughout
has been the suppression of competition
in the production, transportation
and sale of refined oil and to
obtain a monopoly therein; that between
1870 and 1882 the purpose was
effected by agreements between many
persons and corporations engaged in
this business; that in the latter year
the business was made certain by vesting
in nine trustees, including five of<span class="pagenum" id="Page64">[64]</span>
the persons named above, sufficient
stock in the thirty-nine corporations
then concerned to suppress competition
among themselves; that this plan
was acted upon until it was declared
illegal by the Supreme Court of Ohio,
in an action against the Standard Oil
Company of Ohio, one of said corporations,
in 1892; that during the seven
years following, the same individual
defendants, as a majority of the liquidating
trustees, were pretending to
liquidate the trust, but as a matter of
fact were managing all the corporations
in the same old way and were
exercising the same control over them;
that in 1899 the individual defendants
increased the capital stock of the
Standard Oil Company, of New Jersey,
from $10,000,000 to $110,000,000;
that the company was then a producing
and selling corporation, and that
they added to its functions the power
of purchasing stock in other companies,
and practically all the powers
exercised by the trustees under the
unlawful agreement of 1882; that the
Standard Oil Company, of New Jersey,
then taking the place of the
trustees, acquired all the stock of the
corporations theretofore held and controlled
by the trusts, paying therefor
by the issue of its own shares in
exchange; that the President of the
Board of Trustees became the president
of the Standard Oil Company,
of New Jersey, that the trust assumed
the direction of the business of the
Standard Oil Company, of New Jersey,
and has continued it ever since.</p>

<p>After this summary of Standard
Oil history, the petition goes on to
say that the purpose and effect of the
corporation as a holding company was
precisely the same as the purpose and
effect of the appointment of the trustees
previously referred to, namely:
to suppress competition between the
corporations and limited partnerships,
whose stock was first held by the
trusts and then by the Standard Oil
Company, of New Jersey; that by the
foregoing methods, and by securing
railroad rates which discriminated in
favor of the corporations whose stock
was held by the holding company, the
latter was enabled to secure a monopoly
in large sections of the country,
with the result that prices to consumers
are much higher in those sections
than in sections where competition, to
some extent, prevails.</p>

<p>The bill further sets forth that
from 1882 to 1895 the Standard paid
dividends amounting to $512,000,000
on a professed valuation of a trifle
less than $70,000,000, besides accumulating
a surplus &#8220;of unknown magnitude,&#8221;
and that for the last nine years
the dividends have run from 33 to
48 per cent.</p>

<p>Almost on the very day that this
bill was filed the Standard declared
a quarterly dividend which aggregated
$10,000,000.</p>

<p>In filing this bill Attorney General
Moody said that the question of criminal
prosecution would be left &#8220;for
future consideration.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="survey">Criminal Prosecution.</h3>

<p>Whatever may be the disposition of
the Attorney General of the United
States in regard to the criminal prosecution
of Standard Oil officers and
directors, there seems to be no doubt
as to the attitude of Prosecutor David,
of the state of Ohio. The grand jury
of Hancock county has returned an
indictment against the Standard Oil
Company, of Ohio, and against John
D. Rockefeller, president of the Standard
Oil Company, of New Jersey, as
well as three directors of the subsidiary
corporation in the Buckeye state.
Previous proceedings against the same
defendants, taken on an information
brought before the Probate Court of
that state, are now being held up,
pending the decision of the higher
court as to the jurisdiction of the
court below. The present indictments
by the grand jury are based on the
evidence adduced in the previous trial.<span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span>
Conviction would subject the defendant
company to a maximum fine of
five thousand dollars, which, however,
it is believed, may be imposed for
ever day covered in the indictments.
Mr. Rockefeller and the directors of
the subsidiary company would be subject
to the same fine and to imprisonment
for a period of from six months
to one year. More recently Prosecutor
David is quoted as expressing the
belief that he has sufficient evidence
to bring not only Mr. Rockefeller, but
all the highest officials of the controlling
company before the Ohio courts.</p>

<p>In the meantime he has taken steps
to secure an alternative writ of mandamus
against the Buckeye Pipe Line
Company, said to be owned by the
Standard Oil Company and operated
in such a manner as to stifle competition,
requiring that the defendant
provide for the public equal and just
facilities and demanding that they fix
a schedule of rates.</p>

<p>In St. Louis the Federal grand jury
has brought in two indictments, with
a total of seventy-two counts, against
the Waters-Pierce Oil Company for
violation of the Elkins Anti-Rebate
law. If convicted on all the counts
the maximum penalties would exceed
a million and a half dollars.</p>

<p>The proceedings taken by the attorney
general of Texas to oust the same
company from that state have developed
a collateral sensation of great
size. Attorney General Davidson
demands of the defendant company
certain vouchers which, it is alleged,
will show that Senator Joseph W.
Bailey was paid various sums of
money by the Waters-Pierce Company
to secure its readmission to the state,
and gives out that if this evidence is
not forthcoming, secondary evidence
will be offered to establish the alleged
fact. Senator Bailey indignantly
denies that he received any such sums,
and announces that he will prosecute
for perjury anyone who swears to the
existence of such evidence. Senator
Bailey has already been nominated by
primary, but his re-election will come
before the legislature which convenes
in January.</p>

<p>In the meantime the New York
Central Railroad and the Sugar Trust
have been fined heavily for, respectively,
giving and receiving rebates.</p>

<h3 class="survey">The Insurance Situation.</h3>

<p>One of the results of the investigation
conducted by the Armstrong
committee into the affairs of the New
York and the Mutual Life insurance
companies was the enactment of legislation
providing that the affairs of
the two companies should be taken out
of the hands of the existing boards of
trustees, that all outstanding proxies
should be invalidated and that the
policy holders should be given an
opportunity to choose the men who
should thereafter manage the affairs
of the two companies. In pursuance
of this law the policy holders began
voting on Nov. 18 and continued to
cast their ballots for or against the
administration tickets until Dec. 18.
In the New York Life the administration
ticket consisted of &#8220;the best
of the old trustees,&#8221; together with
some new blood, while an opposition
ticket was presented by the International
Policy-Holders Committee, of
which the Hon. Richard Olney was
chairman. In the Mutual contest
there were three tickets: an administration
ticket, the United Committee&#8217;s
ticket and a fusion ticket. The second
of these was so called because it was
the product of the united efforts of the
Mutual Policy Holders&#8217; committee and
the International Policy Holders&#8217; committee
of which Mr. Samuel Untermyer
was the chief organizer and
sponsor. The fusion ticket was made
up of candidates from the administration
and the Mutual Policy
Holders&#8217; respective rosters. At the
time we go to press the result of the
elections is not known.</p>

<h3 class="survey">Canadian Affairs.</h3>

<p>Up in Canada they are still telling
the story of the <i>habitant</i> who, when
told that the Queen was dead, asked,
&#8220;Who is Queen now?&#8221; He was told
that there was no Queen, but a King
had ascended the throne, whereupon
the admiring peasant exclaimed, &#8220;My,
what a pull he must have with
Laurier!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Canadian parliament assembled
at Ottawa on Nov. 22&mdash;four months
earlier than usual&mdash;with its Liberal
majority practically unimpaired, and
the Premier continues to hold the pre-eminence
in Canadian affairs indicated
by the artless tribute of the

<p>The Dominion has not escaped the
muck-rakers, and the Conservatives
are bringing wholesale charges of corruption

<p>On Nov. 29 Minister of Finance
Fielding introduced his long anticipated
tariff bill. Briefly stated, this
measure provides for an intermediate
tariff, the rates of which shall be
between the preferential rates conceded
to the mother country and the
general tariff which applies to other
countries. This intermediate tariff
may be held out as a basis of reciprocity
negotiations with such
countries as show a disposition to meet
the Canadian government half way.</p>

<h3 class="survey">Cuba and South America.</h3>

<p>The situation in Central and South
America is unusually quiet. As a

working forces on the Panama Canal
have been completely reorganized. It
has been definitely decided not to
appoint a governor of the Canal Zone
to succeed Magoon, and an order has
been promulgated to give Chairman
Shonts more complete control over the
administration portion of canal construction,
while Chief Engineer
Stevens is placed in absolute control
over Panama. Bids for the contract
to complete the canal will be opened
Jan. 12.</p>

<p>Cipriano Castro, the fire-eating

state of health, and the end may come
at any time.</p>

<p>Alfonso Penna was inaugurated

<p>The youth of the land, and even the
children of larger growth, will be glad
to know that according to recent investigations
the Island of Juan Fernandez,
so dear to the hearts of every boy
who has grown up on Robinson Crusoe,
was not sunk into the sea by the
disaster, as at first announced, but
remains intact.</p>

<p>Gov. Magoon has declared vacant
the seats of the senators and representatives
elected to the Cuban Congress
in 1905, and another election
will be held. The rivalry of Moderates
and Liberals continues, while the
Liberals, particularly, are divided
among themselves. It is evident that
American occupation of the island
must continue for some time.</p>

<h3 class="survey">Separation of Church and State.</h3>

<p>That order of history which is
&#8220;philosophy teaching by example&#8221;
has been moving steadily and persistently
over the face of Europe toward
a policy which the fathers of our own
republic foresaw and adopted a
hundred and twenty years ago. Perhaps
the most pronounced feature of
Liberalism in the Old World today is
the conviction that the separation of
church and state must become an
accomplished fact. A movement so
vast could not be carried forward
without being complicated in some
measure with bigotry and fanaticism,
but on the whole it may be said that
it is inspired and sustained by the
highest motives of state policy.</p>

</div>

<p>The present Liberal ministry in
England, which succeeded the Balfour
government, appealed to the country
on the issue of free trade and was
overwhelmingly sustained. But since
that time it is safe to say that the
Education bill, introduced by Augustine
Birrell, President of the Board of
Education&mdash;and whimsically called
the &#8220;Birreligious bill&#8221;&mdash;has been the
measure most discussed by the British
people and the world at large. Briefly
stated, this bill provides that, beginning
with January of next year, only
such schools as are provided by the
local educational authorities throughout
England shall be recognized as
public schools, and after that date no
public funds can legally be spent on
any other schools. In other words, if
the present denominational voluntary
schools wish to receive government
support they must become public
schools, and as such must be content
with the same undenominational
teaching that is given in other public
schools. The bill provides, further,
that attendance shall not be compulsory,
and that there shall be no religious
test for teachers chosen by the
local authorities. In those schools
which are taken over by the educational<span class="pagenum" id="Page68">[68]</span>
authorities from the religious
organizations&mdash;by the consent of the
latter, of course&mdash;religious instruction
may be given two mornings a
week, but not by the regular staff of
teachers, and not at the public
expense. The bill further provides
that $5,000,000 shall be appropriated
for educational purposes by the government.</p>

<p>This measure, which has set all
England in a ferment, was passed by
the House of Commons, but in the
House of Lords it met vigorous opposition,
particularly from the spiritual
peers, headed by the Archbishop of
Canterbury. On Dec. 6 it passed the
upper house, so mutilated as to be
unacceptable to the Commons. The
agitation in favor of mending or ending
the chamber of peers has been coming
prominently forward. No basis
of compromise between the upper and
lower house has yet been found. Since
the Education bill is sent back to the
House of Commons with its most vital
features stricken out, the Liberal Government
will probably go on to other
legislation, equally unacceptable to
the peers, and thus force them to
reject a number of measures which
are demanded by the people. They
will then appeal to the country, and
the ending of a system of hereditary
legislators may be involved in the
popular mandate.</p>

<p class="caption">PREMIER GEORGES CLEMENCEAU.</p>

<p>On the Liberal program is a bill
abolishing plural voting. Under the
present system of property qualification
a large landowner may not only
vote where he resides but in every
other place where he has property,
and as the elections do not occur in
England, as they do in this country,
on one and the same day, it is entirely
practicable for such a landowner actually
to vote for half a dozen parliamentary
candidates. Of course the
peers will oppose any reform of the
present system of plural voting, and
thereby will come in collision with popular
sentiment again. The land
tenure bill, by which a tenant may
secure greater permanency in his lease
or compensation for improvements in
case he is dispossessed, and the trades
unions bill, exempting the funds of
labor unions from damage suits
against members of such unions who
may commit a tort, are also in the
Liberal program, and both will be
resisted by the upper house, thereby
contributing to its own undoing.</p>

<h3 class="survey">Disestablishment in France.</h3>

<p>While in England there are issues
which dispute the first place with the
Education bill, there can be no doubt
as to the pre-eminence, just at this
time, of the administration of the law
providing for separation of Church
and State in France. It was early
in December, 1905, that the French
Senate adopted a measure which
abrogated the Concordat, signed in
1801 by the First Napoleon and Pope
Pius VII. This measure had already
passed the Chamber of Deputies in
July. In France the churches are
owned by the state and the clergy<span class="pagenum" id="Page69">[69]</span>,
regardless of denomination, are supported
by the government, a member
of the cabinet known as the Minister
of Public Worship, having supervision
of ecclesiastical affairs. According
to the terms of the new bill, no
newly made clergyman of any denomination
is to receive support from the
government of the republic. Those
now getting it from the state will continue
to do so, but the appropriations
are to be decreased as the pensions and
salaries of the clergyman now in office
expire or are withdrawn. The
churches and other places of religious
worship will continue to belong to the
state, but they are to be leased to congregations
of the churches or denominations
now worshipping in them.
The Vatican is bitterly opposing the
separation act, and there has been considerable
delay in forming the associations
to take over the church
property under the terms of the law.
Originally it was provided that the
period during which these associations
should be formed would expire on
December 11, 1906, but there is no
intention on the part of the Clemenceau
ministry, which came into power
late in October, to persecute the
church. M. Briand, Minister of Public
Worship and the author of the
bill, announced in the Chamber of
Deputies on Nov. 10, that church
property not claimed by the &#8220;cultural
associations&#8221; by Dec. 11 would pass
under control of the state and finally
go to the communes at the end of the
ensuing year, but that in the meantime
the churches will remain at the
disposition of the clergy. The way
is thus left open to the Vatican by the
admission of the possibility that
church property can be granted by
state decree to associations formed
before December 11, 1907.</p>

<p>The government&#8217;s inventories of
church property were completed without
arousing as much hostility as they
did in the beginning but as we go to
press great excitement prevails.</p>

<h3 class="survey">To Abolish Capital Punishment.</h3>

<p>Not only is the French government
pursuing a peaceful policy toward the
church, as far as possible, but a
humane measure is now pending which
is well worthy of an era of civilization
and enlightenment. A parliamentary
commission, to which the matter
was referred, has, by a vote of
eight to two, reported in favor of
abolishing the death penalty, and substituting
life imprisonment. In
extreme cases, solitary confinement is
recommended. It is not generally
known, perhaps, that many of the
leading countries of Europe have long
since abolished the death penalty,
except in trials by court martial. It
seems a mockery that Russia should
be no exception to this rule, but in
point of fact it was the Empress
Catherine the Great who took the
initiative in abolishing capital punishment.
That the law is apparently
disregarded is due to the fact that the
greater part of Russia is subjected to
what is known as &#8220;the minor state of
siege,&#8221; which admits of the application
of military law to the trial of
political prisoners. Capital punishment
was abolished in Greece forty
odd years ago, and since that time
Roumania, Portugal, and the Netherlands
in the order named, have followed
suit. It has been in comparatively
recent years that Italy, Switzerland
and Norway adopted the same
measure of clemency, on the other side
of the water, and Brazil and Venezuela
in the southern part of our own
hemisphere. So the civilized countries
which still retain capital punishment
are the United States, Great
Britain, Germany, Sweden, Austria
and Spain.</p>

<h3 class="survey">Liberalism in Spain.</h3>

<p>The leaven of Liberalism has been
working mightily in the direction of
the severance of church and state in
the land of the Inquisition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span></p>

<p>The weak and capricious youngster
who occupies the throne of Spain
sent assurances to the Pope, late in
October, of his filial attachment, and
all that sort of thing. Six days later
he signed the Associations bill, which
had just passed the Chamber of
Deputies, restricting the power and
influence of the church in a degree
but slightly less than in France. Then
he made a little speech. There is an
old Spanish custom that the premier
should give a banquet at the end of
each year that he and his colleagues
in the ministry have been continuously
in office. In view of the fact,
as the young king recalled, that one
hundred and twelve ministers had
taken the oath before him during the
four years and a half since his coronation,
there had been no banquets at
the expense of an incumbent premier.
Alfonso, in signing the Associations
bill, expressed the hope that Gen.
Lopez Dominguez, who was then at the
head of the Liberal ministry, with a
large Liberal majority behind him in
the Cortes, &#8220;would be able to reintroduce
so pleasant a custom.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the premier said he hoped so,
too.</p>

<p>Having passed the lower house and
received the signature of the king,
the reform measure which is agitating
all Spain went back to the Senate. It
must pass that body, and again
receive the signature of the king, to
become the law of the land.</p>

<p>Since 1876, when the Roman
Catholic Church was reestablished
as the state religion of Spain, after a
period of seven years of freedom of
thought, of education, of burial, etc.,
the Liberals have been slowly regaining
the liberties secured by the revolution
of 1868. The church has made
strenuous resistance and has pursued
a reactionary policy which has finally
aroused all the liberal and progressive
forces. The state already provided
that marriages between Roman
Catholics must be recorded in the
civil register in order to have legal
validity, but the church contends that
civil unions are valid only when they
are performed according to canon
law. The church has also arrayed
itself against the municipal control of
cemeteries, and demands that the custom
of setting apart certain sections
of such cemeteries for the burial of
foreigners and non-Catholic Spaniards
shall be discontinued. Now the
Liberals, who are in power, have
taken the bit in their teeth, so to
speak. It is proposed to emancipate
the schools from monastic teaching,
and to require a state registration of
all the monastic orders in Spain, of
which there is a large and increasing
number since the agitation began in
France. In short the state will insist
upon the absolute control of civil
marriages, the municipal control of
the cemeteries, and a strict regulation
of the monastic orders.</p>

<p>In the meantime Gen. Dominguez
will not give that dinner. One faction
in the Cortes thought that some
time should be devoted to a consideration
of the budget, as well as to the
separation act, and he was forced to
resign. A new cabinet was formed
which lasted just three days&mdash;including
a Sunday&mdash;and resigned. The
Marquis de Armijo has succeeded in
forming another cabinet, with old
Gen. Weyler, by the way, as minister
of war, and he is endeavoring to go
on&mdash;with what success remains to be
seen.</p>

<h3 class="survey">Germany&#8217;s Isolation.</h3>

<p>It is becoming very evident that
the Triple Alliance, consisting of
Italy, Germany and Austria, is becoming
weaker every year. The
feebleness with which Italy supported
Germany&#8217;s pretentions in the
Algeciras conference aroused the
resentment of the Kaiser, who made
it a point to telegraph his thanks to
Austria for the part she took on that<span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span>
same occasion, thereby administering
a silent rebuke to the kingdom beyond
the Alps. This luke-warmness on the
part of Italy is but one of many elements
which go to establish the isolation
of Germany among European
powers. Prince von Buelow, the
German chancellor, in an address at
the opening of the Reichstag, did the
best he could to convince the world
that his imperial master had no
sinister designs against anybody, but
the powers still look upon the Kaiser
with suspicion, and it is very apparent
that he feels it keenly.</p>

<p>In the meantime France and England
are drawing closer and closer
together. The Anglo-Russian &#8220;understanding&#8221;
is said to be very satisfactory
at present. The rumor went that
the basis of this understanding between
the Czar and King Edward
was that both governments should
keep out of Tibet, that lower Persia
should be given over to England as
her sphere of influence, while Russia
confined herself to the northern part,
and finally that England should consent
to the opening of the Dardanelles
to the Russian Black Sea fleet.
The last item discredits the whole
program.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>The rumor runs that the Shah of
Persia is practically dying and his son
has been called to assume the regency.
The Shah, before he was taken ill,
granted a national parliament to his
people, of which, however, little has
been heard of late. What the policy
of his son would be if he should succeed
permanently to the throne is
problematical, but behind the occupant
of the Persian throne and the
policy he may adopt, there is always
the shadow of what is called, by
acknowledged pre-eminence, &#8220;the
Eastern question,&#8221; which will continue
to exist until Russia can get
some satisfactory port where her fleets
will not be frozen up in winter and
she may be free to sail the seas with
her men-of-war and her merchant-men.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>The elections for the Russian duma
have not yet been held, but the assembly
is expected to convene by March
1. The government is improving the
time disfranchising everybody who is
likely to be hostile to the divine right
of kings, is executing or exiling
political prisoners, while the peasants
are being systematically robbed of the
relief sent to prevent them from starving
during the prevailing famine.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>The lower house of the Austrian
parliament, after a stormy agitation
of more than a year, has passed a bill
granting the franchise to every male
Austrian over twenty-four years of
age who is able to read and write, and
has been a resident for at least a year
in the place where an election is held.
The upper house is not inclined to
accept the bill, demanding two votes
for married men over 35 years of age,
but it is hoped that a compromise may
be effected.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>In the Far East, China is becoming
more and more suspicious of Japan&#8217;s
intentions in Manchuria, and is discouraging
the attendance of Chinese
students upon Japanese schools and
colleges. Strong measures have been
taken to suppress the use of opium
within ten years.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>Australia is still gasping at the
decision of Western Australia to withdraw
from the commonwealth and set
up a government of its own.</p>

<p>In this movement, the Western section
probably has the entire sympathy
of Ex-Governor Bill Stone, of Pennsylvania,
who is busy just now advocating
the separation of the Western
half of his own state from the Eastern
half, so contaminated by wicked
Philadelphia!</p>

Boyd stood at the
open door of her corn-house,
a square, one-storied
hut made of the
trunks of young pine-trees,
the bark of
which, being worm-eaten,
was crumbling from the smooth
hard-wood. She had a tin pail on her
arm, and was selecting &#8220;nubbins&#8221; for
her cow from the great heap of
husked corn which, like a mound of
golden nuggets, lay within. The
strong-jawed animal could crunch the
dwarfed ears, grain and corn together,
when they were stirred into a mush
made of wheat-bran and dish-water.</p>

erect figure was now heavy, and bent
as if from toil. Her hair, which in
her youth had been a luxuriant golden
brown, was now thinner and liberally
streaked with gray. From her eyes
deep wrinkles diverged, and the corners
of her firm mouth were drawn
downward. Her face, even in repose,
wore an almost constant frown, and
this habit had deeply gashed her forehead
with lines that deepened when
she was angry.</p>

<p>With her pail on her arm, she was
turning back towards her cottage,
which stood about a hundred yards to
the right, beneath the shade of two
giant oaks, when she heard her name
called from the main-travelled road,
which led past her farm, on to Darley,
ten miles away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you, Mrs. Waycroft!&#8221; she
exclaimed, without change of countenance,
as the head and shoulders of a
neighbor appeared above the rail-fence.
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t imagine who it
was calling me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it was me,&#8221; the woman said,
as Mrs. Boyd reached the fence and
rested her pail on the top rail. &#8220;I
hain&#8217;t seed you since I seed you at
church, Sunday. I tried to get over
yesterday, but was too busy with one
thing and another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon you have had your hands
full planting cotton,&#8221; said Mrs. Boyd.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect you; besides, I&#8217;ve
had all I could do in my own field.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my boys have been hard at
it,&#8221; said Mrs. Waycroft. &#8220;I don&#8217;t go
to the field myself, like you do. I
reckon I ain&#8217;t hardy enough, but keeping
things for them to eat and the
house in order takes all my time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; said Mrs. Boyd, studying
the woman&#8217;s face closely under the
faded black poke-bonnet&mdash;&#8220;I reckon
you&#8217;ve got something to tell me. You
generally have. I wish I could not
care a snap of the finger what folks
say, but I&#8217;m only a natural woman. I
want to hear things sometimes when I
know they will make me so mad that I
won&#8217;t eat a bite for days.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Waycroft looked down at the
ground. &#8220;Well,&#8221; she began, &#8220;I
reckon you know thar would be considerable
talk after what happened at
meeting Sunday. You know a thing
like that naturally <i>would</i> stir up a
quiet community like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, when I think of it I can see
there would be enough said, but I&#8217;m
used to being the chief subject of idle
talk. I&#8217;ve had twenty odd years of it,
Mary Waycroft, though this public
row was rather unexpected. I didn&#8217;t
look for abuse from the very pulpit in
God&#8217;s house, if it <i>is</i> His. I didn&#8217;t
know you were there. I didn&#8217;t know a
friendly soul was nigh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was there clean through
from the opening hymn. A bolt
from heaven on a sunny day couldn&#8217;t
have astonished me more than I was
when you come in and walked straight
up the middle aisle, and sat down just
as if you&#8217;d been coming there regular
for all them years. I reckon you had
your own private reasons for making
the break.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did.&#8221; The wrinkled mouth
of the speaker twitched nervously.
&#8220;I&#8217;d been thinking it out, Mrs. Waycroft,
for a long time and trying to
pray over it, and at last I come to the
conclusion that if I didn&#8217;t go to
church like the rest, it was an open
admission that I acknowledged myself
worse than others, and so I determined
to go&mdash;I determined to go if it
killed me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to think you was rewarded
that way!&#8221; answered Mrs. Waycroft;
&#8220;it&#8217;s a shame! Ann Boyd, it&#8217;s a dirty
shame!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a long time before I
darken a church door again,&#8221; said
Mrs. Boyd. &#8220;If I&#8217;m ever seen there
it will be after I&#8217;m dead and they take
me there feet foremost to preach over
my body. I didn&#8217;t look around, but I
knew they were all whispering about
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never saw the like in your life,
Ann,&#8221; the visitor said. &#8220;Heads were
bumping together to the damagement
of new spring hats, and everybody
was asking what it meant. Some said
that, after meeting, you was going up
and give your hand to Brother Bazemore
and ask him to take you back, as
a member, but he evidently didn&#8217;t
think you had a purpose like that, or
he wouldn&#8217;t have opened up on you
as he did. Of course, everybody thar
knowed he was hitting at you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, they all knew, and he had
no reason for thinking I wanted to
ask any favor, for he knows too well
what I think of him. He hates the
ground I walk on. He has been
openly against me ever since he come
to my house and asked me to let the
Sunday-school picnic at my spring
and in my grove. I reckon I gave it
to him pretty heavy that day, for all
I&#8217;d been hearing about what he had to
say of me had made me mad. I let
him get out his proposal as politely as
such a sneaking man could, and then I
showed him where I stood. Here
Mrs. Waycroft, I&#8217;ve been treated like
a dog and an outcast by every member
of his church for the last twenty
years, called the vilest names a
woman ever bore by his so-called
Christian gang, and then, when they
want something I&#8217;ve got&mdash;something
that nobody else can furnish quite as
suitable for their purpose&mdash;why he
saunters over to my house holding the
skirts of his long coat as if afraid of
contamination, and calmly demands
the use of my property&mdash;property
that I&#8217;ve slaved in the hot sun and
sleet and rain to pay for with hard
work. Oh, I was mad! You see, that
was too much, and I reckon he never
in all his life got such a tongue-lashing.
When I came in last Sunday
and sat down, I saw his eyes flash,
and knew if he got half an excuse he
would let out on me. I was sorry I&#8217;d
come then, but there was no backing
out after I&#8217;d got there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When he took his text I knew he
meant it for you,&#8221; said the other
woman. &#8220;I have never seen a madder
man in the pulpit, never in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page75">[75]</span>
life. While he was talking, he never
once looked at you, though he knew
everybody else was doing nothing else.
Then I seed you rise to your feet. He
stopped to take a drink from his goblet,
and you could &#8217;a&#8217; heard a pin fall,
it was so still. I reckon the rest
thought like I did, that you was going
right up to him and pull his hair or
slap his jaws. You looked like you
hardly knowed what you was doing,
and, for one, I tuck a free breath
when you walked straight out of the
house. What you did was exactly
right, as most fair-minded folks will
admit, though I&#8217;m here to tell you,
my friend, that you won&#8217;t find fair-minded
folks very plentiful hereabouts.
The fair-minded ones are over
there in that graveyard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyd stroked her quivering
lips with her hard, brown hand, and
said, softly: &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t going to sit
there and listen to any more of it.
I&#8217;d thrown aside pride and principle
and gone to do my duty to my religion,
as I saw it, and thought maybe
some of them&mdash;one or two, at least&mdash;would
meet me part of the way, but I
couldn&#8217;t listen to a two hours&#8217; tirade
about me and my&mdash;my misfortune.
If I&#8217;d stayed any longer, I&#8217;d have
spoken back to him, and that would
have been exactly what he and some
of the rest would have wanted, for
then they could have made a case
against me in court for disturbing
public worship, and imposed a heavy
fine. They can&#8217;t bear to think that,
in spite of all their persecution, I&#8217;ve
gone ahead and paid my debts and
prospered in a way that they never
could do with all their sanctimony.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. A
gentle breeze stirred the leaves of the
trees and the blades of long grass
beside the road. There was a far-away
tinkling of cow and sheep bells
in the lush-green pastures which
stretched out towards the frowning
mountain against which the setting
sun was levelling its rays.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say you haven&#8217;t seen anybody
since Sunday,&#8221; remarked the
loitering woman, in restrained, tentative
tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve been right here. Why
did you ask me that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, Ann,&#8221; was the slow
answer, &#8220;talking at the rate Bazemore
was to your face, don&#8217;t you
think it would be natural for him to&mdash;to
sort o&#8217; rub it on even heavier
behind your back, after you got up
that way and went out so sudden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought of it, but I can
see now that it would be just like
him.&#8221; Mrs. Boyd took a deep breath
and lowered her pail to the ground.
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she went on, reflectively, as
she drew herself up again and leaned
on the fence, &#8220;I reckon he got good
and mad when I got up and left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; The other woman smiled.
&#8220;He was so mad he could hardly
speak. He fairly gulped, his eyes
flashed, and he was as white as a bunch
of cotton. He poured out another
goblet of water that he had no idea of
drinking, and his hand shook so much
that the glass tinkled like a bell
against the mouth of the pitcher.
You must have got as far as the hitching-rack
before his fury busted out. I
reckon what he said was the most
unbecoming thing that a stout, able-bodied
man ever hurled at a defenseless
woman&#8217;s back.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another pause. Mrs.
Boyd&#8217;s expectant face was as hard as
stone; her dark-gray eyes were two
burning fires in their shadowy orbits.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;You might as well tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Waycroft avoided her companion&#8217;s
fierce stare. &#8220;He looked
down at the place where you sat, Ann.
right steady for a minute, then he
said: &#8216;I&#8217;m glad that woman had the
common decency to sit on a seat by
herself while she was here; but I hope
when meeting is over that some of you
brethren will take the bench out in
the woods and burn it. I&#8217;ll pay for a
new one out of my own pocket.<span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; The exclamation seemed
wrung from her when off her guard,
and Mrs. Boyd clutched the rail of
the fence so tightly that her strong
nails sunk into the soft wood. &#8220;He
said <i>that</i>! He said that <i>about me</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and he ought to have been
ashamed of himself,&#8221; said Mrs. Waycroft;
&#8220;and if he had been anything
else than a preacher, surely some of
the men there&mdash;men you have
befriended&mdash;would not have set still
and let it pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they <i>did</i> let it pass,&#8221; said
Mrs. Boyd, bitterly; &#8220;they did let it
pass, one and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, nobody would dare, in
this section, to criticise a preacher,&#8221;
said the other. &#8220;What any little,
spindle-legged parson says goes the
same as the word of God out here in
the backwoods. I&#8217;d have left the
church myself, but I knowed you&#8217;d
want to hear what was said; besides,
they all know I&#8217;m your friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they all know you are the
only white woman that ever comes
near me. But what else did he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he had lots to say. He said
he hadn&#8217;t mentioned no names, but it
was always the hit dog that yelped,
and that you had made yourself a
target by leaving as you did. He
went on to say that, in his opinion, all
that was proved at court against you
away back there was just. He said
some folks misunderstood Scripture
when it come to deal with your sort
and stripe. He said some argued that a
church door ought always to be wide
open to any sinner whatsoever, but
that in your daily conduct of holding
every coin so tight that the eagle on it
squeals, and in giving nothing to send
the Bible to the heathens, and being
eternally at strife with your neighbors,
you had showed, he said, that no
good influence could be brought to
bear on you, and that people who was
really trying to live upright lives
ought to shun you like they would a
catching disease. He &#8217;lowed you&#8217;d
had the same Christian chance in
your bringing-up, and a better education
than most gals, and had deliberately
throwed it all up and gone your
headstrong way. In his opinion, it
would be wrong to condone your past,
and tell folks you stood an equal
chance with the rising generation
fetched up under the rod and Biblical
injunction by parents who knowed
what lasting scars the fires of sin
could burn in a living soul. He said
the community had treated you right,
in sloughing away from you, ever
since you was found out, because you
had never showed a minutes&#8217; open
repentance. You&#8217;d helt your head,
he thought, if possible, higher than
ever, and in not receiving the social
sanction of your neighbors, it looked
like you was determined to become the
richest woman in the state for no
other reason than to prove that wrong
prospered.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker paused in her recital.
The listener, her face set and dark
with fury, glanced towards the cottage.
&#8220;Come in,&#8221; she said, huskily;
&#8220;people might pass along and know
what we are talking about, and, somehow,
I don&#8217;t want to give them that
satisfaction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; said Mrs. Waycroft;
&#8220;they say I fetch you every bit
of gossip, anyway. A few have quit
speaking to me. Bazemore would himself,
if he didn&#8217;t look to me once a
month for my contribution. I hope
what I&#8217;ve told you won&#8217;t upset you,
Ann, but you always say you want to
know what&#8217;s going on. It struck me
that the whole congregation was about
the most heartless body of human
beings I ever saw packed together in
one bunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to tell me one other
thing,&#8221; said Mrs. Boyd, tensely, as
they were entering the front doorway
of the cottage&mdash;&#8220;was Jane Hemingway
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, by a large majority. I
forgot to tell you about her. I had
my eyes on her, too, for I knowed it
would tickle her nigh to death, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page77">[77]</span>
did. When you left she actually giggled
out loud and turned back an&#8217;
whispered to the Mayfield girls. Her
old, yellow face fairly shone, she was
that glad, and when Bazemore went
on talking about you and burning
that bench, she fairly doubled up,
with her handkerchief clapped over
her mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyd drew a stiff-backed chair
from beneath the dining-table and
pushed it towards her guest. &#8220;There
is not in hell itself, Mary Waycroft, a
hatred stronger than I feel right now
for that woman. She is a fiend in
human shape. That miserable creature
has hounded me every minute
since we were girls together. As God
is my judge, I believe I could kill her
and not suffer remorse. There was a
time when my disposition was as sweet
and gentle as any girl&#8217;s, but she
changed it. She has made me what I
am. She is responsible for it all. I
might have gone on&mdash;after my&mdash;my
misfortune, and lived in some sort of
harmony with my kind if it hadn&#8217;t
been for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; said the other
woman, as she sat down and folded
her cloth bonnet in her thin hands.
&#8220;I really believe you&#8217;d have been a
different woman, as you say, after&mdash;after
your trouble if she had let you
alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyd seated herself in another
chair near the open door, and looked
out at a flock of chickens and ducks
which had gathered at the step and
were noisily clamoring for food.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw two things that made my
blood boil as I was leaving the
church,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I saw Abe Longley,
who has been using my pasture
for his cattle free of charge for the
last ten years. I caught sight of his
face, and it made me mad to think
he&#8217;d sit there and never say a word in
defence of the woman he&#8217;d been using
all that time; and then I saw George
Wilson, just as indifferent, near the
door, when I&#8217;ve been favoring him
and his shabby store with all my trade
when I could have done better by
going on to Darley. I reckon neither
of those two men said the slightest
thing when Bazemore advised the&mdash;burning
of the bench I&#8217;d sat on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, of course not!&#8221; said Mrs.
Waycroft, &#8220;nobody said a word.
They wouldn&#8217;t have dared, Ann.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they will both hear from
me,&#8221; said Mrs. Boyd, &#8220;and in a way
that they won&#8217;t forget soon. I tell
you, Mary Waycroft, this thing has
reached a climax. That burning
bench is going to be my war-torch.
They say I&#8217;ve been at strife with my
neighbors all along; well, they&#8217;ll see
now. I struggled and struggled with
pride to get up to the point of going
to church again, and that&#8217;s the reception
I got.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity to entertain hard feelings,
but I don&#8217;t blame you a single
bit,&#8221; said Mrs. Waycroft, sympathetically.
&#8220;As I look at it, you have
done all you can to live in harmony,
and they simply won&#8217;t have it. They
might be different if it wasn&#8217;t for
that meddlesome old Jane Hemingway.
She keeps them stirred up. She
and her daughter is half starving to
death, while you&mdash;&#8221; Mrs. Waycroft
glanced round the room at the warm
rag carpet of many colors, at the neat
fire-screen made of newspaper pictures
pasted on a crude frame of
wood, and, higher, to the mantel-piece,
whose sole ornament was a Seth
Thomas clock, with the Tower of London
in glaring colors on the glass
door&mdash;&#8220;while you don&#8217;t ask anybody
any odds. Instead of starving, gold
dollars seem to roll up to your door of
their own accord and fall in a heap.
They tell me even that cotton factory
which you invested in, and which Mrs.
Hemingway said had busted and gone
up the spout, is really doing well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The stock has doubled in value,&#8221;
said Mrs. Boyd, simply. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know how to account for my making
money. I reckon it&#8217;s simply good
judgment and a habit of throwing
nothing away. The factory got to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page78">[78]</span>
pretty low ebb, and the people lost
faith in it, and were offering their
stock at half price. My judgment
told me it would pull through as soon
as times improved, and I bought an
interest in it at a low figure. I was
right; it proved to be a fine investment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sorter sorry for Virginia
Hemingway, Sunday,&#8221; said Mrs.
Waycroft. &#8220;When her mother was
making such an exhibition of herself
in gloating over the way you was
treated, the poor girl looked like she
was ashamed, and pulled Jane&#8217;s
apron like she was trying to keep her
quiet. I reckon you hain&#8217;t got nothing
against the girl, Ann?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing except that she is that
devilish woman&#8217;s offspring,&#8221; said Mrs.
Boyd. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to dislike her;
she&#8217;s pretty&mdash;by all odds the prettiest
and sweetest-looking young woman in
this county. Her mother in her prime
never saw the day she was anything
like her. They say Virginia isn&#8217;t
much of a hand to gossip and abuse
folks. I reckon her mother&#8217;s ways
have disgusted her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s it,&#8221; said the other
woman, as she rose to go. &#8220;I know I
love to look at her; she does my old
eyes good. At meeting I sometimes
gaze steady at her for several minutes
on a stretch. Sitting beside that
hard, crabbed old thing, the girl certainly
does look out of place. She
deserves a better fate than to be tied
to such a woman. I reckon she&#8217;ll be
picked up pretty soon by some of these
young men&mdash;that is, if Jane will give
her any sort of showing. Jane is so
suspicious of folks that she hardly lets
Virginia out of her sight. Well, I
must be going. Since my husband&#8217;s
death I&#8217;ve had my hands full on the
farm; he did a lots to help out, even
about the kitchen. Good-bye. I can
see what I&#8217;ve said has made a change
in you, Ann. I never saw you look
quite so different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the whole thing has kind o&#8217;
jerked me round,&#8221; replied Mrs. Boyd.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve taken entirely too much off of
these people&mdash;let them run over me
dry-shod; but I&#8217;ll show them a thing
or two. They won&#8217;t let me live in
peace, and now they can try the other
thing.&#8221; And Ann Boyd stood in the
doorway and watched the visitor
trudge slowly away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she mused, as she looked
out into the falling dusk, &#8220;they are
trying to drive me to the wall with
their sneers and lashing tongues. But
I&#8217;ll show then that a worm can turn.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="annboyd"><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span></h3>

<p>The next morning, after a frugal
breakfast of milk and cornmeal
pancake, prepared over an open
fireplace on live coals, which reddened
her cheeks and bare arms,
Mrs. Boyd pinned up her skirts
till their edges hung on a level
with the tops of her coarse, calf-skin
shoes. She then climbed over the
brier-grown rail-fence with the agility
of a hunter and waded through the
high, dew-soaked weeds and grass in
the direction of the rising sun. The
meadow was like a rolling green sea
settling down to calmness after a
storm. Here and there a tuft of dewy
broom-sedge held up to her vision a
sheaf of green hung with sparkling
diamonds, emeralds, and rubies, and
far ahead ran a crystal creek in and
out among gracefully drooping willows
and erect young reeds.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s his brindle heifer now,&#8221;
the trudging woman said, harshly.
&#8220;And over beyond the hay-stack and
cotton-shed is his muley cow and calf.
Huh, I reckon I&#8217;ll make them strike a
lively trot! It will be some time
before they get grass as rich as mine
inside of them to furnish milk and
butter for Abe Longley and his sanctimonious
lay-out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly walking around the animals,
she finally got them together and
drove them from her pasture to the
small road which ran along the foot of
the mountain towards their owne<span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span>r&#8217;s
farm-house, the gray roof of which
rose above the leafy trees in the distance.
To drive the animals out, she
had found it necessary to lower a
panel of her fence, and she was replacing
the rails laboriously, one by one, when
she heard a voice from the woodland
on the mountain-side, a tract of
unproductive land owned by the man
whose cows she was ejecting. It was
Abe Longley himself, and in some surprise
he hurried down the rugged
steep, a woodman&#8217;s axe on his
shoulder. He was a gaunt, slender
man, gray and grizzled, past sixty
years of age, with a tuft of stiff beard
on his chin, which gave his otherwise
smooth-shaven face a forbidding
expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on thar, Sister Boyd!&#8221; he
called out, cheerily, though he seemed
evidently to be trying to keep from
betraying the impatience he evidently
felt. &#8220;You must be getting nigh-sighted
in yore old age. As shore as
you are a foot high them&#8217;s my cattle,
an&#8217; not yourn. Why, I knowed my
brindle from clean up at my woodpile,
a full quarter from here. I seed
yore mistake an&#8217; hollered then, but I
reckon you are gettin&#8217; deef as well as
blind. I driv&#8217; &#8217;em in not twenty minutes
ago, as I come on to do my cuttin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you did, Abe Longley,&#8221;
and Mrs. Boyd stooped to grasp and
raise the last rail and carefully put it
in place; &#8220;I know they are yours. My
eyesight&#8217;s good enough. I know good
and well they are yours, and that is
the very reason I made them hump
themselves to get off my property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but,&#8221; and the farmer, thoroughly
puzzled, lowered his glittering
axe and stared wonderingly&mdash;&#8220;but
you know, Sister Boyd, that you told
me with your own mouth that, being
as I&#8217;d traded off my own pasture-land
to Dixon for my strip o&#8217; wheat in the
bottom, that I was at liberty to use
yourn how and when I liked, and, now&mdash;why,
I&#8217;ll be dad-blamed if I understand
you one bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I understand what I&#8217;m
about, Abe Longley, if you don&#8217;t!&#8221;
retorted the owner of the land. &#8220;I
<i>did</i> say you could pasture on it, but I
didn&#8217;t say you could for all time and
eternity; and I now give you due
notice if I ever see any four-footed
animal of yours inside of my fences
I&#8217;ll run them out with an ounce of
buckshot in their hides.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, well!&#8221; Longley cried,
at the end of his resources, as he leaned
on his smooth axe-handle with one
hand and clutched his beard with the
other. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to make
of yore conduct. I can&#8217;t do without
the use of your land. There hain&#8217;t a
bit that I could rent or buy for love
or money on either side of me for
miles around. When folks find a
man&#8217;s in need of land, they stick the
price up clean out of sight. I was
tellin&#8217; Sue the other day that we was
in luck havin&#8217; sech a neighbor&mdash;one
that would do so much to help a body
in a plight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m very good and kind,&#8221;
sneered Mrs. Boyd, her sharp eyes
ablaze with indignation, &#8220;and last
Sunday in meeting you and a lot of
other able-bodied men sat still and
let that foul-mouthed Bazemore say
that even the wooden bench I sat on
ought to be taken out and burned for
the public good. You sat there and
listened to <i>that</i>, and when he was
through you got up and sung the
doxology and bowed your head while
that makeshift of a preacher called
down God&#8217;s benediction on you. If
you think I&#8217;m going to keep a pasture
for such a man as you to fatten your
stock on, you need a guardian to look
after you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; Longley exclaimed, a
crestfallen look on him. &#8220;You are
goin&#8217; to blame us all for what he
said, and you are mad at everybody
that heard it. But you are dead
wrong, Ann Boyd&mdash;dead wrong. You
can&#8217;t make over public opinion, and
you&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; been better off years ago if
you hadn&#8217;t been so busy trying to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span>
it, whether or no. Folks would let
you alone if you&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; showed a more
repentant sperit, and not held your
head so high and been so spiteful.
I reckon the most o&#8217; your trouble&mdash;that
is, the reason it&#8217;s lasted so long,
is due to the women-folks more than
the men of the community, anyhow.
You see, it sorter rubs women&#8217;s wool
the wrong way to see about the only
prosperity a body can see in the entire
county falling at the feet of the one&mdash;well,
the one least expected to have
sech things&mdash;the one, I mought say,
who hadn&#8217;t lived exactly up to the
<i>best</i> precepts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t go to men like you for my
precepts,&#8221; the woman hurled at him,
&#8220;and I haven&#8217;t got any time for
palavering. All I want to do is to
give you due notice not to trespass on
my land, and I&#8217;ve done that plain
enough, I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Abe Longley&#8217;s thin face showed
anger that was even stronger than
his avarice; he stepped nearer to her,
his eyes flashing, his wide upper-lip
twitching nervously. &#8220;Do you know,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;that it&#8217;s purty foolhardy of
you to take up a fight like that agin
a whole community. You know you
hain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; to make a softer bed to
lie on. You know, if you find fault
with me for not denouncin&#8217; Bazemore,
you may as well find fault with every
living soul that was under reach o&#8217;
his voice, fer nobody budged or said a
word in yore defence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m taking up a fight with no
one,&#8221; the woman said, firmly. &#8220;They
can listen to what they want to listen
to. The only thing I&#8217;m going to do
in future is to see that no person uses
me for profit and then willingly sees
me spat upon. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got to
say to you.&#8221; And, turning, she
walked away, leaving him standing as
if rooted among his trees on the
brown mountain-side.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll go home and tell his wife,
and she&#8217;ll gad about and fire the
whole community against me,&#8221; Mrs.
Boyd mused; &#8220;but I don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;ll
have my rights if I die for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour later, in another dress and
a freshly washed and ironed gingham
bonnet, she fed her chickens from a
pan of wet cornmeal dough, locked up
her house carefully, fastened down
the window-sashes on the inside by
placing sticks above the movable
ones, and trudged down the road to
George Wilson&#8217;s country-store at the
crossing of the roads which led respectively
to Springtown, hard-by on
one side, and Darley, farther away on
the other.</p>

<p>The store was a long, frame building
which had once been whitewashed,
but was now only a fuzzy, weather-beaten
gray. As was usual in such
structures, the front walls of planks
rose higher than the pointed roof, and
held large and elaborate lettering
which might be read quite a distance
away. Thereon the young storekeeper
made the questionable statement
that a better price for produce
was given at his establishment than
at Darley, where high rent, taxes,
and clerk-hire had to be paid, and,
moreover, that his goods were sold
cheaper because, unlike the town
dealers, he lived on the products from
his own farm and employed no help.
In front of the store, convenient alike
to both roads, stood a rustic hitching-rack
made of unbarked oaken poles
into which railway spikes had been
driven, and on which horseshoes had
been nailed to hold the reins of any
customer&#8217;s mount. On the ample
porch of the store stood a new machine
for the hulling of peas, several
ploughs, and a red-painted device for
the dropping and covering of seed-corn.
On the walls within hung various
pieces of tinware and harnesses
and saddles, and the two rows of
shelving held a good assortment of
general merchandise.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Boyd entered the store,
Wilson, a blond young man with
an ample mustache, stood behind the
counter talking to an Atlanta drummer<span class="pagenum" id="Page81">[81]</span>
who had driven out from Darley
to sell the storekeeper some dry-goods
and notions, and he did not come to
her at once, but delayed to see the
drummer make an entry in his order-book;
then he advanced to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Mrs. Boyd,&#8221; he smiled,
&#8220;I am ordering some new prints for
you ladies, and I wanted to see that
he got the number of bolts down right.
This is early for you to be out, isn&#8217;t
it? It&#8217;s been many a day since I&#8217;ve
seen you pass this way before dinner.
I took a sort of liberty with you yesterday,
knowing how good-natured
you are. Dave Prixon was going your
way with his empty wagon, and, as I
was about to run low on your favorite
brand of flour, I sent you a barrel
and put it on your account at the old
price. I thought you&#8217;d keep it. You
may have some yet on hand, but this
will come handy when you get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t intend to keep it,&#8221;
replied the woman, under her bonnet,
and her voice sounded harsh and
crisp. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t touched it. It&#8217;s
out in the yard where Prixon dumped
it. If it was to rain on it I reckon it
would mildew. It wouldn&#8217;t be my
loss. I didn&#8217;t order it put there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mrs. Boyd!&#8221; and Wilson&#8217;s
tone and surprised glance at the
drummer caused that dapper young
man to prick up his ears and move
nearer; &#8220;why, it&#8217;s the best brand I
handle, and you said the last gave you
particular satisfaction, so I naturally&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want it; I didn&#8217;t
order it, and I don&#8217;t intend to have
you nor no one else unloading stuff in
my front yard whenever you take a
notion and want to make money by
the transaction. Deduct that from
my bill, and tell me what I owe you.
I want to settle in full.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but&mdash;&#8221; Wilson had never
seemed to the commercial traveller to
be so much disturbed; he was actually
pale, and his long hands, which rested
on the smooth surface of the counter,
were trembling&mdash;&#8220;but I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221;
he floundered. &#8220;It&#8217;s only the
middle of the month, Mrs. Boyd, and
I never run up accounts till the end.
You are not going <i>off</i>, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; and the woman pushed
back her bonnet and eyed him almost
fiercely, &#8220;you needn&#8217;t any of you
think that. I&#8217;m going to stay right
on here; but I&#8217;ll tell you what I am
going to do, George Wilson&mdash;I&#8217;m
going to buy my supplies in the future
at Darley. You see, since this talk of
burning the very bench I sit on in
the house of God, which you and your
ilk set and listen to, why&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mrs. Boyd,&#8221; he broke in,
&#8220;now don&#8217;t go and blame me for what
Brother Bazemore said when he
was&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Brother</i> Bazemore!&#8221; The woman
flared up and brought her clinched
hand down on the counter. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
never as long as I live let another dollar
of my money pass into the hands
of a man who calls that man brother.
You sat still and raised no protest
against what he said, and that ends
business between us for all time.
There is no use talking about it.
Make out my account, and don&#8217;t keep
me standing here to be stared at like
I was a curiosity in a side-show.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Mrs. Boyd; I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221;
faltered Wilson, with a glance at the
drummer, who, feeling that he had
been alluded to, moved discreetly
across the room and leaned against the
opposite counter. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go back to the
desk and make it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood motionless where he had
left her till he came back with her
account in his hand, then from a
leather bag she counted out the money
and paid it to him. The further faint,
half-fearful apologies which Wilson
ventured on making seemed to fall on
closed ears, and, with the receipted
bill in her bag, she strode from the
house. He followed her to the door
and stood looking after her as she
angrily trudged back towards her
farm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; he sighed, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span>
drummer came to his elbow and stared
at him wonderingly, &#8220;there goes the
best and most profitable customer I&#8217;ve
had since I began selling goods. It&#8217;s
made me sick at heart, Masters. I
don&#8217;t see how I can do without her,
and yet I don&#8217;t blame her one bit&mdash;not
a bit, so help me God.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="annboyd"><span class="smcap">Chapter III.</span></h3>

<p>Wilson turned, and with a frown
went moodily back to his desk and sat
down on the high stool gloomily eyeing
the page in a ledger which he had
just consulted.</p>

<p>&#8220;By George, that woman&#8217;s a corker,&#8221;
said the drummer, sociably, as he
came back and stood near the long
wood-stove. &#8220;Of course, I don&#8217;t know
what it&#8217;s all about, but she&#8217;s her own
boss, I&#8217;ll stake good money on that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s about the sharpest and in
many ways the strongest woman in
the state,&#8221; said the storekeeper, with
a sigh. &#8220;Good Lord, Masters, she&#8217;s
been my main-stay ever since I opened
this shack, and now to think because
that loud-mouthed Bazemore, who
expects me to pay a good part of his
salary, takes a notion to rip her up
the back in meeting, why&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see!&#8221; cried the drummer&mdash;&#8220;I
understand it now. I heard about
that at Darley. So <i>she&#8217;s</i> the woman!
Well, I&#8217;m glad I got a good look at
her. I see a lot of queer things in
going about over the country, but I
don&#8217;t think I ever ran across just her
sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s had a devil of a life, Masters,
from the time she was a blooming,
pretty young girl till now that
she is at war with everybody within
miles of her. She&#8217;s always been a
study to me. She&#8217;s treated me more
like a son than anything else&mdash;doing
everything in her power to help me
along, buying, by George, things
sometimes that I knew she didn&#8217;t need
because it would help me out, and
now, because I didn&#8217;t get up in meeting
last Sunday and call that man
down she holds me accountable. I
don&#8217;t know but what she&#8217;s right. Why
should I take her hard-earned money
and sit still and allow her to be
abused? She&#8217;s simply got pride, and,
lots of it, and it&#8217;s bad hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what was it all about?&#8221; the
drummer inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;The start of it was away back
when she was a girl, as I said,&#8221; began
the storekeeper. &#8220;You&#8217;ve heard of
Colonel Preston Chester, our biggest
planter, who lives a mile from here&mdash;old-time
chap, fighter of duels, officer
in the army, and all that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I&#8217;ve seen him; in fact, I
was at college at the State University
with his son Langdon. He was a
terrible fellow&mdash;very wild and reckless,
full half the time, and playing
poker every night. He was never
known to pay a debt, even to his best
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Langdon is a chip off of the old
block,&#8221; said Wilson. &#8220;His father
was just like him when he was a young
man. Between you and me, the
Colonel never had a conscience; old as
he now is, he will sit and laugh about
his pranks right in the presence of
his son. It&#8217;s no wonder the boy turned
out like he did. Well, away back
when this Mrs. Boyd was a young
and pretty girl, the daughter of honest,
hard-working people, who owned
a little farm back of his place, he took
an idle fancy to her. I&#8217;m telling you
now what has gradually leaked out
in one way and another since. He
evidently won her entire confidence,
made her believe he was going to
marry her, and, as he was a dashing
young fellow, she must have fallen in
love with him. Nobody knows how
that was, but one thing is sure, and
that is that he was seen about with
her almost constantly for a whole
year, and then he stopped off suddenly.
The report went out that he&#8217;d
made up his mind to get married to a
young woman in Alabama who had a
lot of money, and he did go off and
bring home the present Mrs. Chester,
Langdon&#8217;s mother. Well, old-timers<span class="pagenum" id="Page83">[83]</span>
say young Ann Boyd took it hard,
stayed close in at home and wasn&#8217;t
seen out for a couple of years. Then
she came out again, and they say she
was better-looking than ever and a
great deal more serious and sensible.
Joe Boyd was a young farmer
those days, and a sort of dandy,
and he fell in love with her and
hung about her day and night,
never seeming willing to let her out
of his sight. Several other fellows,
they say, was after her, but she seemed
to like Joe the best, but nothing
he&#8217;d do or say would make her accept
him. I can see through it now,
looking back on what has since leaked
out, but nobody understood it then,
for she had evidently got over her
attachment for Colonel Chester, and
Joe was a promising fellow, strong,
good-looking, and a great beau and
flirt among women, half a dozen being
in love with him, but Ann simply
wouldn&#8217;t take him, and it was the talk
of the whole county. He was simply
desperate, folks say, going about boring
everybody he met with his love
affair. Finally her mother and father
and all her friends got after her to
marry Joe, and she gave in. And then
folks wondered more than ever why
she&#8217;d delayed for she was more in love
with her husband than anybody had
any reason to expect. They were happy,
too. A child was born, a little girl,
and that seemed to make them happier.
Then Mrs. Boyd&#8217;s mother and father
died, and she came into the farm, and
the Boyds were comfortable in every
way. Then what do you think happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wondering all along,&#8221;
the drummer laughed. &#8220;I can see
you&#8217;re holding something up your
sleeve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this happened. Colonel
Chester&#8217;s wife was, even then, a
homely woman, about as old as he
was, and not at all attractive aside
from her money, and marrying hadn&#8217;t
made him any the less devilish. They
say he saw Mrs. Boyd at meeting one
day and hardly took his eyes off of
her during preaching. She had developed
into about the most stunning-looking
woman anywhere about, and
knew how to dress, which was something
Mrs. Chester, with all her
chances, had never seemed to get onto.
Well, that was the start of it, and
from that day on Chester seemed to
have nothing on his mind but the good
looks of his old sweetheart. Folks saw
him on his horse riding about where he
could get to meet her, and then it got
reported that he was actually forcing
himself on her to such an extent that
Joe Boyd was worked up over it, aided
by the eternal gab of all the women in
the section.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Colonel Chester&#8217;s wife get
onto it?&#8221; the drummer wanted to
know.</p>

<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t seem like she did,&#8221;
answered Wilson. &#8220;She was away
visiting her folks in the South most
of the time, with Langdon, who was
a baby then, and it may be that she
didn&#8217;t care. Some folks thought she
was weak-minded; she never seemed
to have any will of her own, but left
the Colonel to manage her affairs without
a word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, go on with your story,&#8221;
urged the drummer.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t much more to tell
about the poor woman,&#8221; continued
Wilson. &#8220;As I said, Chester got to
forcing himself on her, and I reckon
she didn&#8217;t want to tell her husband
what she was trying to forget for fear
of a shooting scrape, in which Joe
would get the worst of it; but this
happened: Joe was off at court in Darley
and sent word home to his wife
that he was to be held all night on a
jury. The man that took the message
rode home alongside of Chester and
told him about it. Well, I reckon, all
hell broke out in Chester that night.
He was a drinking man, and he tanked
up, and, as his wife was away, he had
plenty of liberty. Well, he simply went
over to Joe Boyd&#8217;s house and went in.
It was about ten o&#8217;clock. My honest<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
conviction is, no matter what others
think, that she tried her level best to
make him leave without rousing the
neighborhood, but he wouldn&#8217;t go, but
sat there in the dark with his coat off,
telling her he loved her more than her
husband did, and that he never had
loved his wife and that he was crazy
for her, and the like. How long this
went on with her imploring and praying
to him to go, I don&#8217;t know; but, at
any rate, they both heard the gate-latch
click and Joe Boyd come right up
the gravel-walk. I reckon the poor
woman was scared clean out of her
senses, for she made no outcry, and
Chester went to a window, his coat on
his arm, and was climbing out when
Joe, who couldn&#8217;t get in at the front
door was making for the one in the
rear, met him face to face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great goodness!&#8221; ejaculated the
commercial traveller.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you bet, the devil was to
pay,&#8221; went on the storekeeper grimly.
&#8220;Chester was mad and reckless, and,
being hot with liquor, and regarding
Boyd as far beneath him socially,
instead of making satisfactory explanations,
they say he simply swore at
Boyd and stalked away. Dumfounded,
Boyd went inside to his miserable
wife and demanded an explanation.
She has since learned how to use her
wits with the best in the land, but
she was young then, and so, by her
silence, she made matters worse for
herself. He forced her to explain,
and, seeing no other way out of the
affair, she decided to throw herself on
his mercy and make a clean breast of
things she and her family had kept
back all the time. Well, sir, she confessed
to what had happened away
back before Chester had deserted her,
no doubt telling a straight story of her
absolute purity and faithfulness to
Boyd after marriage. Poor old Joe!
He wasn&#8217;t a fighting man, and, instead
of following Chester and demanding
satisfaction, he stayed at home that
night, no doubt suffering the agony of
the damned and trying to make up
his mind to believe in his wife and to
stand by her. As it looks now, he
evidently decided to make the best of
it, and might have succeeded, but
somehow it got out about Chester
being caught there, and that started
gossip so hot that her life and his
became almost unbearable. It might
have died a natural death in time, but
Mrs. Boyd had an enemy, Mrs. Jane
Hemingway, who had been one of the
girls who was in love with Joe Boyd.
It seems that she had never got over
Joe&#8217;s marrying another woman, and
when she heard this scandal she
nagged and teased Joe about his babyishness
in being willing to believe his
wife, and told him so many lies that
Boyd finally quit staying at home,
sulking about in the mountains, and
making trips away till he finally
applied for a divorce. Ignorant and
inexperienced as she was, and proud,
Mrs. Boyd made no defence, and the
whole thing went his way with very
little publicity. But the hardest part
for her to bear was when, having the
court&#8217;s decree to take charge of his
child, Boyd came and took it away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious! that was tough,
wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; exclaimed the drummer.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what it was, and they say
it fairly upset her mind. They expected
her to fight like a tiger for her
young, but at the time they came for
it she only seemed stupefied. The
little girl was only three years old, but
they say Ann came in the room and
said she was going to ask the child if
it was willing to leave her, and they
say she calmly put the question, and
the baby, not knowing what she
meant, said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then they say
Ann talked to it as if it were a grown
person, and told her to go, that she&#8217;d
never give her a thought in the future,
and never wanted to lay eyes on her
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was pitiful, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
said Masters. &#8220;By George, we don&#8217;t
dream of what is going on in the
hearts of men and women we meet
face to face every day. And tha<span class="pagenum" id="Page85">[85]</span>t&#8217;s
what started her in the life she&#8217;s since
led.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she lived in her house like a
hermit, never going out unless she
absolutely had to. She had an old-fashioned
loom in a shed-room adjoining
her house, and night and day
people passing along the road could
hear her thumping away on it. She
kept a lot of fine sheep, feeding and
shearing them herself, and out of the
wool she wove a certain kind of jean
cloth which she sold at a fancy figure.
I&#8217;ve seen wagon loads of it pass
along the road billed to a big house in
Atlanta. This went on for several
years, and then it was noticed that
she was accumulating money. She
was buying all the land she could
around her house, as if to force folks
as far from her as possible, and she
turned the soil to good purpose, for
she knew how to work it. She hired
negroes for cash, when others were
paying in old clothes and scraps, and,
as she went to the field with them
and worked in the sun and rain like a
man, she got more out of her planting
than the average farmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So she&#8217;s really well off?&#8221; said the
drummer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got more than almost anybody
else in the county,&#8221; said Wilson.
&#8220;She&#8217;s got stocks in all sorts of things,
and owns houses on the main street in
Darley, which she keeps well rented.
It seems like, not having anything else
to amuse her, she turned her big brain
to economy and money-making, and
I&#8217;ve always thought she did it to hit
back at the community. You see, the
more she makes, the more her less fortunate
neighbors dislike her, and she
loves to get even as far as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And has she had no associates at
all?&#8221; Masters wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes, there is one woman, a
Mrs. Waycroft, who has always been
intimate with her. She is the only&mdash;I
started to say she was the only one,
but there was a poor mountain fellow,
Luke King, a barefoot boy who
had a fine character, a big brain on
him, and no education. His parents
were poor, and did little for him.
They say Mrs. Boyd sort of took pity
on him and used to buy books and
papers for him, and that she really
taught him to read and write. She
sent him off to school, and got him on
his feet till he was able to find work
in a newspaper office over at Canton,
where he became a boss typesetter.
I&#8217;ve always thought that her misfortune
had never quite killed her natural
impulses, for she certainly got fond
of that fellow. I had an exhibition
of both his regard and hers right here
at the store. He&#8217;d come in to buy
something or other, and was waiting
about the stove one cold winter day,
when a big mountain chap made a
light remark about Mrs. Boyd. He
was a head taller than Luke King
was, but the boy sprang at him like a
panther and knocked the fellow down.
They had the bloodiest fight I ever
saw, and it was several minutes before
they could be separated. Luke had
damaged the chap pretty badly, but
he was able to stand, while the boy
keeled over in a dead faint on the
floor, bruised inside some way. The
big fellow, fearing arrest, mounted
his horse and went away, and several
of us were doing what we could with
cold water and whiskey to bring the
boy around when who should come in
but Ann herself. She was passing
the store, and some one told her about
it. People who think she has no heart
and is as cold as stone ought to have
seen her that day. In all my life I
never saw such a terrible face on a
human being. I was actually afraid
of her. She was all fury and all tenderness
combined. She looked down at
him in all his blood and bruises and
white face, and got down on her knees
by him. I saw a great big sob rise
up in her, although her back was to
me, and shake her from head to foot,
and then she was still, simply stroking
back his damp, tangled hair. &#8216;My
poor boy,&#8217; I heard her say, &#8216;you can&#8217;t
fight my battles. God Himself has<span class="pagenum" id="Page86">[86]</span>
failed to do that, but I won&#8217;t forget
this&mdash;never&mdash;never!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, that was strong!&#8221; said Masters.
&#8220;She must be wonderful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is more wonderful than her
narrow-minded enemies dream of,&#8221; returned
the storekeeper. &#8220;You see, its
her pride that keeps her from showing
her fine feelings, and it&#8217;s her secluded
life that makes them misunderstand
her. Well, she brought her wagon
and took the boy away. That was
another queer thing,&#8221; Wilson added.
&#8220;She evidently had started to take
him to her house, for she drove as far
as the gate and then stopped there to
study a moment, and finally turned
round and drove him to the poor
cabin his folks lived in. You see, she
was afraid that even that would cause
talk, and it would. Old Jane Hemingway
would have fed on that morsel for
months, as unreasonable as it would
have been. Ann sent a doctor, though,
and every delicacy the market afforded,
and the boy was soon out. It
wasn&#8217;t long afterward that Luke King
went to college at Knoxville, and now
he&#8217;s away in the West somewhere.
His mother, after his father&#8217;s death,
married a trifling fellow, Mark Bruce,
and that brought on some dispute
between her and her son, who had
tried to keep her from marrying such
a man. They say Luke told her if
she did marry Bruce he&#8217;d go away
and never even write home, and so far,
they say, he has kept his word. Nobody
knows where he is or what he&#8217;s
doing unless it is Mrs. Boyd, and
she never talks. I can&#8217;t keep from
thinking he&#8217;s done well, though, for
he had a big head on him and a lot of
determination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this Mrs. Hemingway, her
enemy,&#8221; said the drummer tentatively,
&#8220;you say she was evidently the
woman&#8217;s rival at one time. But it
seems she married some one else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, she suddenly accepted
Tom Hemingway, an old bachelor,
who had been trying to marry her for
a long time. Most people thought she
did it to hide her feelings when Joe
Boyd got married. She treated Tom
like a dog, making him do everything
she wanted, and he was daft about
her till he died, just a couple of weeks
after his child was born, who, by-the-way,
has grown up to be the prettiest
girl in all the country, and that&#8217;s
another feature in the story,&#8221; the
storekeeper smiled. &#8220;You see, Mrs.
Boyd looks upon old Jane as the prime
cause of her losing her <i>own</i> child, and
I understand she hates the girl as
much as she does her mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>A man had come into the store and
stood leaning against a show-case on
the side devoted to groceries.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a customer,&#8221; said the
drummer; &#8220;don&#8217;t let me keep you,
old man; you know you&#8217;ve got to look
at my samples some time to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll go see what he wants,&#8221;
said Wilson, &#8220;and then I&#8217;ll look
through your line, though I don&#8217;t feel
a bit like it, after losing the best regular
customer I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>The drummer had opened his sample-case
on the desk when Wilson came
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say the woman&#8217;s husband
took the child away,&#8221; remarked the
drummer; &#8220;did he go far?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They first settled away out in Texas,&#8221;
replied Wilson, &#8220;but Joe Boyd,
not having his wife&#8217;s wonderful head
to guide him, failed at farming there,
and only about three years ago he
came back to this country and bought
a little piece of land over in Gilmer&mdash;the
county that joins this one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, so near as that! Then perhaps
she has seen her daughter
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, they&#8217;ve never met,&#8221; said
Wilson, as he took a sample pair of
men&#8217;s suspenders from the case and
tested the elastic by stretching it
between his hands. &#8220;I know that for
certain. She was in here one morning
waiting for one of her teams to
pass to take her to Darley, when a
peddler opened his pack of tin-ware
and tried to sell her some pieces I<span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span>
was out of. He heard me call her by
name, and, to be agreeable, he asked
her if she was any kin to Joe Boyd
and his daughter, over in Gilmer. I
could have choked the fool for his
stupidity. I tried to catch his eye
to warn him, but he was intent on selling
her a bill, and took no notice of
anything else. I saw her stare at him
steady for a second or two, then she
seemed to swallow something, and
said, &#8216;No, they are no kin of mine.&#8217;
And then what did the skunk do
but try to make capital out of that.
&#8216;Well, you may be glad,&#8217; he said,
&#8216;that they are no kin, for they
are as near the ragged edge as any
folks I ever ran across.&#8217; He went on
to say he stayed overnight at Boyd&#8217;s
cabin and that they had hardly anything
but streak-o&#8217;-lean-streak-o&#8217;-fat
meat and corn-bread to offer him,
and that the girl had the worst temper
he&#8217;d ever seen. Mrs. Boyd, I
reckon to hide her face, was looking at
some of the fellow&#8217;s pans, and he
seemed to think he was on the right
line, and so he kept talking. Old Joe,
he said, had struck him as a good-natured,
lazy sort of come-easy-go-easy
mountaineer, but the girl looked
stuck up, like she thought she was
some better than appearances would
indicate. He said she was a tall, gawky
sort of girl, with no good looks to
brag of, and he couldn&#8217;t for the life
of him see what she had to make her
so proud.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wondered what Mrs. Boyd was
going to do, but she was equal to that
emergency, as she always has been in
everything. She held one of his pans
up in the light and tilted her bonnet
back on her head, I thought, to let me
see she wasn&#8217;t hiding anything, and
said, as unconcerned as if he&#8217;d never
mentioned a delicate subject. &#8216;Look
here,&#8217; she said, thumping the bottom
of the pan with her finger, &#8216;if you
expect to do any business with <i>me</i>,
you&#8217;ll have to bring copper-bottom
ware to me. I don&#8217;t buy shoddy stuff
from any one. These pans will rust
through in two months. I&#8217;ll take half
a dozen, but I&#8217;m only doing it to pay
you for the time spent on me. It is a
bad investment for any one to buy
cheap, stamped ware.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h2>Life and Times of Andrew Jackson.</h2>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="author">BY THOS. E WATSON.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="dropcapp"><img src="images/dropcapa.jpg" alt="A" width="88" height="100" class="dropcapi" /><span class="noshow">A</span>ndrew
Jackson was born on March 15,
1767.</p>

<p>There has been a hot dispute over the place of
his birth, but the weight of the legal evidence
favors South Carolina.</p>

<p>His parents were immigrants from the northern
part of Ireland, where the people are mainly
Presbyterians in religion, and where there is an inter-mixture of
Scotch blood; but there seems to be no positive proof that the
Jacksons belonged to the over-worked family of Scotch-Irish.</p>

<p>They were poor people, living at Carrickfergus, linen weavers
by trade, and, if any one of them had ever been prominent in any
way, the story is lost. The most painstaking researches made by
enthusiastic hero-worshipers have failed to trace the Jackson
lineage to a single cattle-lifting lord, or to any other member of
that upper world into which the biographical snob is so eager to
cast his anchor.</p>

<p>The Jacksons were plain, common, industrious, honest folks,
who held a respectable, independent place in their own community,
but who were not so prosperous as to resist the temptation
to try their fortunes in the New World.</p>

<p>Hugh Jackson, brother to Andrew&#8217;s father, had been a soldier
in a British regiment, and had served in America. He was
present at Braddock&#8217;s defeat, and may have known Fausett, the
Virginia scout, who is said to have given the rash British general
the wound of which he died. (<i>See note.</i>)</p>

<div class="jacksonnote">

<p class="noindent"><i>Note</i>:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Virginia provincials, under Washington, by their knowledge of border warfare,
and cool courage, alone saved the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Braddock was himself mortally wounded by a provincial named Fausett. A brother of
the latter had disobeyed the silly orders of the General, that the troops should not take position
behind the trees, when Braddock rode up and struck him down. Fausett who saw
the whole transaction, immediately drew up his rifle and shot him through the lungs.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right"><i>&#8220;The Great West,&#8221; Howe.</i></p>

</div><!--jacksonnote-->

<p>Apparently, Hugh Jackson became interested in the efforts of
the Catawba Land Company to colonize its holdings in the Carolinas,
for upon his return to Ireland he began to get together a
band of kinspeople, neighbors and friends, for the purpose of
emigrating to America.</p>

<p>Among those whom Hugh Jackson persuaded was his brother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page92">[92]</span>
Andrew. But, before everything could be got ready for the voyage,
Hugh Jackson fell in love with the daughter of well-to-do
parents, and married her; and the wife of Hugh was so satisfactory
in herself and her surroundings that the happy husband
decided to remain in the old country&mdash;his wife having vetoed his
emigration scheme.</p>

<p>His brother Andrew, however, had probably already made his
arrangements to go to America, and, having got unsettled, found
it not so easy to sink back into his former life; therefore, after
some hesitation, he and the three Crawfords, one of whom was the
husband of his wife&#8217;s sister, took ship for Charleston.</p>

<p>Upon his coming to North Carolina, it seems that Andrew
Jackson was too poor to buy land. Instead, therefore, of locating
in the Waxhaws Settlement, where most of the immigrants from
Carrickfergus had bought homes, he went to Twelve-mile Creek,
a branch of the Catawba.</p>

<p>Here he was seven miles distant from the Waxhaws Settlement,
and was face to face with the gigantic task of carving out
a farm from the wilderness.</p>

<p>The historian, the orator, the painter, have been eager in the
duty of blazoning the deeds of our pioneer missionaries, law-makers
and soldiers. The names of these heroes live, and deserve
to live, in letters of light upon the records of our country. But,
to our pioneer farmers, justice has never been done. Theirs was
a combat calling for every soldierly trait of John Smith and
Miles Standish. The patient courage which swung the axe, in
the depths of primeval woods, was no less heroic than the
bravery which made the musket conquer. The toil of the warrior&#8217;s
march was slight by comparison with the homely, but exhausting,
work of preparing the soil for the sowing of seed. The
arrows of the red men were not more deadly to the soldier than
were the fevers which rose from the swamps and pulled down
the settler as he struggled to open out his farm.</p>

<p>In the South, in the East, in the West, the story of the pioneer
plowman of America is one of dauntless courage, of quiet heroism.
He found the New World a wilderness and he has well-nigh
made it a garden. His axe, his spade, his hoe, his plow, his
muscle, his brain, his very heart and soul have all been enlisted
in the work; and never once have his lips uttered the craven&#8217;s
plea for &#8220;Protection.&#8221; Never once has he gone to the doors of
legislation begging special favors. Never once has he lied to
government and people for the purpose of securing a selfish advantage
at the expense of his fellowman.</p>

<p>No. He has not only not demanded of the government either
Protection or Privilege, but he has submitted&mdash;yes, for one
hundred years he has submitted!&mdash;to be robbed of a portion of
his annual produce in order that our Infant Industry Capitalists
should be able to build up the corporate power which now, in
the form of Trusts, dominates the Republic and secures the lion&#8217;s
share of all the wealth created in every field of industry.</p>

<p>Like many another pioneer of the American wilderness, Andrew
Jackson found the task too hard. He died under the strain.
The impression which his famous son had as to the immediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span>
cause of his death was that he ruptured a blood vessel in the
handling of a heavy log.</p>

<p>The body of the hero who had fallen in the fight for his wife
and little ones&mdash;the fight to make a home for them in the wilderness&mdash;was
buried in the graveyard of the Waxhaw Settlement
church. In after years, when efforts were made to identify the
spot it could not be done.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>According to local tradition, there was held at the cabin-home
of the dead man the grewsome &#8220;wake&#8221; which was customary
among the Irish in the Old Country. Relatives from the
Waxhaw settlement came out to Jackson&#8217;s &#8220;clearing,&#8221; when
they learned that he was no more; and, after preparing the body
for burial, their grief gradually wore itself out, and the whiskey-jug
became the ruling factor of the occasion. As lamentation
gave place to revelry, it is said that &#8220;the corpse came in for his
share of the refreshments.&#8221; What this may mean, each reader
shall judge for himself.</p>

<p>The same tradition claims that the body was hauled from the
cabin to the graveyard upon a rough wooden frame or sled, and
that such was the disorder of the journey that the corpse was
jolted off the sled and &#8220;tumbled on its face in a little bottom,&#8221;
on the banks of Waxhaw Creek, near the crossing.</p>

<p>The man who was riding the horse, which was hitched to the
sled, had not known that he had lost his load until one of the
funeral party in advance, happening to look back, saw &#8220;the sled
bouncing up and down, in a very light way.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had to go back miles before they came to the spot where
the body had rolled off the sled.</p>

<p>The numerous biographers of Andrew Jackson have shunned
this local tradition as something entirely too horrible to put in
print; yet books are only valuable to the extent that they tell the
truth. The story is useful as an illustration of the extreme
roughness of frontier conditions at that time; the poverty of the
Jacksons, and the rude simplicity of border funerals.</p>

<p>The immigrant had gone into the unbroken wilderness to build
his log cabin; and apparently there was no wagon road from his
&#8220;clearing&#8221; to the Waxhaw Settlement.</p>

<p>The use of the wooden frame or sled to carry the body on,
would indicate more strongly the lack of a road than the lack of
a wagon, for, even though the Jacksons had no such vehicle, the
Waxhaw relatives would have brought one if there had been a
passable road. The corpse, tumbling off the sled and being left
behind on its face in the little bottom, is uncanny, but to the dead
the uncanny is not the uncommon.</p>

<p>The brilliant soldier&mdash;son of the Emperor Charles V&mdash;Don
John of Austria, who broke the sea-power of the Turks in the
battle of Lepanto, died dismally in the Netherlands; and his
body was carried on horse-back to Spain, in two sacks&mdash;half of
the body in one sack and half in the other.</p>

<p>When Abraham Lincoln died, his face discolored so rapidly
that those in charge, to save the feelings of the people who would
want to gaze upon the revered features, painted out the shocking<span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span>
discoloration; and, thus artificially masked, the martyred President
was borne to his tomb.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>The widow Jackson and her two little boys did not go back to
the distant, lonely cabin on Twelve Mile Creek. From the
church-ground where the husband and father had been buried,
they went to the home of George McCamie, who had married Mrs.
Jackson&#8217;s sister. Here, within a fortnight of the funeral, a son
was born to the widow; and this son she named Andrew, after
his father.</p>

<p>As soon as she was able to travel, the widow Jackson left the
McCamie home and went to live with James Crawford, her
brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crawford was an invalid, and Mrs. Jackson took charge of
the Crawford housekeeping. Thus she and two of her boys lived
for several years, the oldest son, Hugh, remaining with George
McCamie.</p>

<p class="caption">ANDREW JACKSON.</p>
</div>

<p>The family name of Andrew Jackson&#8217;s mother was Hutchinson.
She had, at least, a primary English education, for it was
she who taught Andrew to read. That she was a woman of
strong, lovable traits, is proven by the sound advice she impressed
upon the mind of her great son, and by the passionate attachment
to her which he carried throughout his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span></p>

<p>After the battle of New Orleans, when the victor had been
crowned with laurel in the Cathedral and acclaimed like a demi-god
through the streets, it was of his mother that he spoke to the
officers whom he was about to disband&mdash;their glorious work being
done.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Gentlemen, if only</i> SHE <i>could have lived to see this day!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>As you follow the narrative of Andrew Jackson&#8217;s career, you
will hear him say many things that you will not approve, will
see him do many things which you cannot applaud, but when you
recall that at the very top-notch of his success and his pride, his
heart stayed in the right place, and was sore because his mother
could not be there to gladden her old eyes with the glory of her
son&mdash;you will forgive him much in his life that was harsh and
cruel and utterly wrong.</p>

<p>During each Winter, for two or three years, after he had
reached the age of seven, Andrew Jackson was sent to the old-field
school of a Mr. Branch. After this, he attended the select
school which a Presbyterian preacher, Dr. David Humphreys,
taught in the Waxhaw settlement. He appears to have been
going to this higher school in the spring of 1780, when the inroad
of Tarleton created a panic in that portion of the Carolinas.
At some later period of his youth, he is said to have attended
the old Queen College or Seminary at Charlotte a couple of terms,
but the time is not definitely known.</p>

<p>As to education, therefore, it may be safely stated that
Andrew Jackson enjoyed much more than the ordinary advantage
of a back-woods boy of his time. At the age of ten, he
had become so good a reader that he was often chosen to read the
newspaper to the assembled neighbors; and he remembered with
pride, in after years, that he had thus had the honor of &#8220;reading
out loud&#8221; the Declaration of Independence upon its arrival in
the Waxhaws. For a lad of ten this was, indeed, something to
remember with honest pride.</p>

<p>He also learned to write &#8220;a good hand,&#8221; which can be easily
read even to this day: he was well up in arithmetic, and was
fond of geography: grammar he detested, as most of us did.
While yet a school-boy he wrote a composition which was in the
nature of a patriotic proclamation, reminding his countrymen
that they must expect occasional defeats and that they could
hope to win only by steady effort and resolute courage.</p>

<p>From the advent of Tarleton, in 1780, and the Buford
Massacre, until the surrender of Cornwallis, the widow Jackson
and her boys were tossed hither and thither in the whirlwind
of the Revolutionary War. The people of the Carolinas were
divided, as they were in other states, some being Tories and in
favor of remaining as subjects of Great Britain, while the
majority were Whigs, and in favor of Independence.</p>

<p>The feud between the two local factions waxed bitter, splitting
into savage groups almost every neighborhood, and often
setting in hostile array, the one against the other, members of
the same family.</p>

<p>The troops sent over to this country by King George committed
many atrocities, some of which historians have shrunk<span class="pagenum" id="Page96">[96]</span>
from recording, but it is also true that many a nameless horror
was perpetrated by our own people upon each other. In the later
stages of the conflict, almost no mercy was shown by Tory to
Whig, or by Whig to Tory.</p>

<p>After Gates&#8217; disastrous defeat at Camden, Andrew Jackson
made his home for a while at the house of Mrs. Wilson, a distant
connection of Mrs. Jackson. This lady lived a few miles from
Charlotte. During his stay with her, Andrew made himself
useful pulling fodder, going to mill, driving the cows to pasture,
gathering vegetables for the table, carrying in the wood, and
taking farm tools to the blacksmith shop to be mended.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson had a son who became Andrew Jackson&#8217;s playmate
and friend; and this son, who was afterward a prominent
minister of the Gospel, used to relate that whenever young
Jackson went to the blacksmith shop he would bring back with
him some new weapon, spear, club, tomahawk, or grass blade with
which to kill the British.</p>

<p>Dr. Wilson remembered having told his mother one day,
when speaking of Jackson, &#8220;Mother, Andy will fight his way
in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>A girl of the neighborhood, who became in due time Mrs.
Smart, happened to see Andrew Jackson as he passed along the
road, on his way to the home of Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p>She described the lad as being almost a scarecrow. He was
riding a little grass-fed pony or colt, which was so small that
the long thin legs of &#8220;the gangling fellow,&#8221; Jackson, could
almost meet under the horse&#8217;s belly. The rider wore a wide-brimmed
hat which flapped down over his face, which was yellow
and worn. His figure was covered with dust, and as this Knight
of the Sorrowful Countenance galloped along the road, he and
his shabby little horse presented the forlornest spectacle that had
ever greeted the laughing eyes of the girl who was to become
known in Jacksonian annals as Mrs. Susan Smart.</p>

<p>Hugh Jackson, the oldest of the three boys, joined the band
of patriots which was raised and equipped, at his own expense,
by that noble leader, Colonel William R. Davie, of South Carolina.
Only sixteen years of age, Hugh Jackson left the field
hospital, where he had been suffering from fever, and joined in
the assault upon Stono Ferry. The excitement, the exertion,
the heat of the day (June 20, 1779), brought on a relapse, and
the gallant youth died.</p>

<p>As to Andrew Jackson, he himself said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it altogether, I saw and heard a good deal of war in
those days, but did nothing toward it myself worth mention.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, he further stated that he acted for Colonel Davie as
mounted orderly, or messenger, &#8220;being a good rider and familiar
with all the roads in those regions.&#8221;</p>

<p>He witnessed the battles of Hanging Rock and Hobkirk&#8217;s
Mill, and took part in a skirmish with the Tories at the house
of Captain Sands.</p>

<p>Andrew and Robert Jackson were taken prisoners, and it
was while so held that the boys were ordered, Robert first and
then Andrew, to clean the boots of one of Tarleton&#8217;s lieutenants.<span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span>
Both refused, and to each was dealt a savage sabre-cut which
had much to do with Robert&#8217;s death soon afterward, and which
gave to Andrew a scar and a hatred which he bore to his grave.</p>

<p>To the rescue of her boys, came Mother Jackson, she who was
&#8220;as gentle as a dove and as brave as a lioness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads were so young, and were in such a desperate plight
with smallpox, that the British officers were perhaps glad to get
rid of such an encumbrance; at any rate they were released or
exchanged, and the forlorn group, the mother and her sick boys,
journeyed back to their home.</p>

<p>But Robert was already so far gone that he died; and when
the smallpox left Andrew he was a mere skeleton. &#8220;It took me
all the rest of the year (1781) to recover my strength and get
flesh enough to hide my bones.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the sacred cause of liberty, Elizabeth Jackson had already
given two of her sons. The third had barely escaped a like fate.
But the golden-hearted woman was not to be cast down, or taught
cowardly prudence. No sooner was Andrew out of danger, than
she sent him to the home of Joseph White, another brother-in-law,
and set out, herself, to carry food and medicine to the sick and
wounded patriots who were confined in the British hulks in
Charleston Harbor.</p>

<p>Braver, it may be, than the soldier himself is the battlefield
nurse who brings water to his parched lips, bandages to his bleeding
wound, tender ministrations to his dying hours.</p>

<p>May it yet come to pass that some time, <span class="smcapall">SOME TIME</span>, in the
unfolding of higher and better things, these angels of Mercy,
the Good Women of the Christian Nations, may be able to rush
in between the lines, as <i>once</i> happened in the days of old, and
stay the hands lifted to shed human blood!</p>

<p>Elizabeth Jackson, in the spirit of consecration, went to what
seemed to her the post of duty, thinking nothing of the cost to
herself.</p>

<p>They were in prison&mdash;her neighbors, friends, compatriots&mdash;and
she did visit them. She brought to the suffering prisoners
words of comfort; messages from home; the motherly sympathy
which heals like a balsam; the kind word which is sweeter than
myrrh.</p>

<p>Then the ministering angel, the best of all created things, a
good woman, passed out of the ship, carrying with her the deadly
fever which knew no difference betwixt the good and the bad.
After a brief illness she died, and she was buried near Charleston;
but, like her husband, her dust lies in a grave that cannot be
found.</p>

<p>After the loss of his mother (in the fall of 1781), Andrew
Jackson remained with Joseph White, a saddler by trade, helping
him in his shop, in the making and mending of saddles and
harness. At the same time, he read everything he could lay his
hands on&mdash;books, pamphlets and newspapers. His uncle&#8217;s father
was a local magistrate, possessed of a book of law forms and
rules of common practice. Most young men would lay such a
book underneath a volume of Sermons, and then spread a layer<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span>
of dust over both; but Andrew Jackson afterward said that he
read and re-read the law book until he knew it by heart.</p>

<p>But at this period in his growth an unfortunate thing happened.
The death of his father and his brothers had left Andrew
Jackson the heir-at-law to a considerable part of the estate of
Hugh Jackson, of Carrickfergus, his grandfather.</p>

<p>The amount, some fifteen hundred or two thousand dollars,
was just about enough to unsettle the average young man,
jostling him out of the routine of dull, monotonous industry&mdash;saddle-mending,
for example.</p>

<p>The legal representative of the Hugh Jackson estate, in
America, was the William Barton, of Charleston, at whose house
Elizabeth Jackson had died. Why it was that he turned over
the money to the young man before he became of age is not
explained. Perhaps Andrew wanted the money, and had made
up his mind to get it. If so, the conduct of Barton is comprehensible.
Whenever Andrew Jackson wanted a thing and made
up his mind to get it, he could become a most troublesome customer.
At all events, Mr. Barton paid over the money to the
boy, and the boy sowed wild oats with it.</p>

<p>He bought a fine horse, and fine equipments for the horse;
he bought fine raiment for his own person, including a gold
watch; he bought a fine pair of pistols, so that he would be ready
in case it became desirable to shoot somebody. In short, he
went to going all the gaits of a fast young man, until his money
was gone.</p>

<p>At the last, he made a bet which would have swept away even
his horse, had he lost; but luck favored him; he won; and it is a
convincing proof of his inborn good sense that he immediately
paid up his debts, and rode his fine horse away from Charleston
and its allurements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Studying Law!</span></p>

<p>To that stage had Andrew Jackson came, in 1785, steered
by the unseen forces which govern the world. It is doubtful
whether he himself could have explained how he happened to
drift into that profession rather than some other.</p>

<p>In the finding of one&#8217;s life-work there is much more of feeling
around in the dark than is generally supposed. Cervantes did
not begin to write Don Quixote until he had tried success by many
routes, and had landed on the wrong side of a prison door.
Bacon&#8217;s best work was done after his disgrace as an officer of state
and after Queen Elizabeth had expressed the weighty opinion that
he didn&#8217;t know much law.</p>

<p>Oliver Goldsmith, the neglected physician, wrote &#8220;The
Deserted Village&#8221; and &#8220;The Vicar of Wakefield&#8221; after he had
waited in vain for patients bringing fees.</p>

<p>Had Napoleon been a success as an author, he might never
have meddled with politics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]</span></p>

<p>Had General Lew Wallace been a success as a soldier, he might
never have written &#8220;Ben Hur.&#8221;</p>

<p>Had U. S. Grant been a money-maker at the outbreak of the
Civil War, he might never have commanded on the winning side
at Appomattox.</p>

<p>Had Sam Houston been able to wear with credit the harness
of social and political existence in Tennessee, he might never
have thrown himself amid the wilder men of the Southwest and
won fame as a builder of empire!</p>

<p>Patrick Henry&#8217;s failure in other fields shunted him into the
legal profession; and Jefferson&#8217;s partial failure as a lawyer
became a stepping-stone into the higher calling of practical statesmanship.</p>

<p>Happy is the man who can find out, early in life, the work
which he is best fitted to do. Among the most pitiable of the
wretched is he who grows old at a task which, too late, he learns
was not set for <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>The gray-haired school-teacher or commonplace preacher,
who realizes that he should have been a merchant, lawyer, doctor
or civil engineer, is pathetic. To know what to try to do is the
great problem, and it may be that even the men who succeed
in their chosen calling could have rendered mankind better service
in some other field.</p>

<p>Henry Brougham&#8217;s shrewd old mother bewailed his quitting
the House of Commons to don the robes of Lord Chancellor: Dr.
Samuel Johnson lamented the fate which never gave him a chance
to try his hand in Parliament: Edmund Burke writhed under
Goldsmith&#8217;s famous lashing of him &#8220;who to party gave up what
was meant for mankind.&#8221;</p>

<p>What is it that draws the most ambitious men of modern
times into &#8220;the study of law&#8221;?</p>

<p>The reward, of course. All things considered, no other profession
offers so great a return upon the investment of time,
talent and industry.</p>

<p>While the nations are standing in arms, clothed in steel from
head to foot, the purpose is not so much to fight as to discourage
attack from without and insurrection from within. The standing
army gives the education whose watchword is &#8220;<i>Obey!</i>&#8221; It
cultivates the class-pride and prejudice upon which caste rule is
built. It interests millions of citizens in the maintenance of
&#8220;Law and Order&#8221;&mdash;the law which imposes the yoke of the ruling
caste and the order which restrains its victims from revolt.</p>

<p>The military profession, therefore, is one which irresistibly
attracts very many aspirants to influence, to position, to power;
but even the military profession does not win over so many
ambitious young men as does &#8220;the study of the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the building up of our civilization we have complicated
matters to such an extent that the lawyer is indispensable, almost
omnipotent.</p>

<p>Does the layman know anything about his own rights as a
citizen? Very little. Upon the simplest things only is he
informed. At every turn he finds himself under the necessity
of getting help from the lawyer. Great is the corporation&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span>
bank, the railroad, the trust&mdash;but the corporation dares not move
a step without a lawyer in the pilot-house.</p>

<p>From the Justice&#8217;s Court in the rural district and the Mayor&#8217;s
Court in the village, all the way up to Presidential policies and
Governmental problems, the lawyer is the doctor who must be
called in to look at the tongue of the difficulty, and to write out
a prescription.</p>

<p>In the business world the lawyer levies his tribute upon the
great and the small, the rich and the poor, the hayseed farmer
and the silk-hat financier.</p>

<p>Our Wall Street Money-Kings would no more think of organizing
a rascally scheme of High Finance without the help of
lawyers than the buccaneers of old would have thought of flying
the pirate flag without guns on board.</p>

<p>In the political world the lawyer is omnipresent, indispensable.</p>

<p>Who organizes the Machine and steers the Boss on his cruise,
keeping him off the reefs and bars of the Criminal Code?</p>

<p>The lawyer.</p>

<p>Who maps out the campaign, devises a fraud upon the people
which the statute cannot quite reach, and then, after the election
has been stolen from the people, shows the Boss how to keep the
stolen goods in defiance of right and in spite of the legal proceedings?</p>

<p>The lawyer.</p>

<p>Who is it that the beneficiaries of class-legislation naturally
select to advance their claims, voice their demands, guard their
interests in the legislatures of states, in the Congress of the
United States, in the Cabinet of the President?</p>

<p>The lawyer.</p>

<p>Under our system, so complex has it become, the man who
wants to do right doesn&#8217;t know how. Except in the simplest
transactions, a lawyer must show him how. If, on the contrary,
a bad man wants to do wrong, but wants to escape punishment,
he needs, and can generally get, a lawyer to show him the way.</p>

<p>The innocent man, accused of crime, needs a lawyer; is not
safe without one, and may be convicted, even then, if he happens
to employ a sorry one, who can be outwitted by the prosecution.</p>

<p>The guilty man, accused of crime, needs a lawyer; is not safe
without one; and if he employs a good one, while the prosecution
is managed by a sorry one, the jury may be forced to turn him
loose, although they feel that he is &#8220;as guilty as a dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus, looked at from the standpoint of mere ambition, sordid
selfishness, the &#8220;study of law&#8221; powerfully attracts young men
who want to get on in the world.</p>

<p>But there is another point of view&mdash;thank God!</p>

<p>It is not every student of Blackstone or Coke who licks his
chops, by anticipation, over the sweets of mental prostitution.</p>

<p>It is not every student of the law who means to become the
jackal to the lion, the doer of dirty work for hire, the seller of
divinely fashioned genius to the highest bidder&mdash;with the morals
of a harlot, without that excuse of dire necessity which the harlot
can often give.</p>

<p>In most cases the boy who comes to the study of the law is<span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span>
actuated by nobler motives, a higher purpose. A generous ambition
to gain knowledge, to fit himself for a leader&#8217;s place among
men, to arm himself with the weapons which enable him to fight
the battles of the weak and to defend the right against the wrong,
find place in his mind and heart, just as they do in the beautiful
language of the oath which he must take.</p>

<p>Almost in the very words&mdash;and quite in the identical spirit&mdash;that
ancient Chivalry solemnly swore the Knight-Errant to his
duty, pledging him to champion the cause of the weak and the
oppressed, the oath of office consecrates the young lawyer to his
work by the same holy vows. For it must be remembered that no
profession has a more glorious tradition and heritage than that
of the law.</p>

<p>The Crusaders who have in modern times gone forth to redeem
the Holy Sepulchre of Truth from the Infidel have been
led, by whom?</p>

<p>The lawyer.</p>

<p>The Knight-Errant who rode forth, panoplied in burnished
steel, to break the chains, lift the yoke, batter down the prison
door of the captive, the weak, the oppressed, has been, whom?</p>

<p>The lawyer.</p>

<p>Great was Mirabeau, but he dreamt only of changing France
into a constitutional monarchy, leaving Divine Right on the
throne and hereditary Privilege in force.</p>

<p>It was Danton, the lawyer, who led <i>the Revolution</i>, and
sketched the Democratic state, in which all the people should rule
for the benefit of all.</p>

<p>It was the lawyer who led in the long, hard fight for Civil
liberty in England; the lawyer who slew the monsters of her
Criminal Code; the lawyer who armed the private citizen with
school-book and ballot.</p>

<p>It was the lawyer who pleaded Ireland&#8217;s cause at the bar of
Public Opinion, wrung from British intolerance Religious Freedom,
compelled the recognition of the Irishman&#8217;s rights in Irish
land, and so won upon the conscience and the fear of the ruling
caste that the triumph of the Cause of Ireland has become a question
of time rather than a matter of doubt.</p>

<p>In our own history, whose record is better than that of the
lawyer?</p>

<p>Would our forefathers ever have gone to war with Great
Britain had they awaited the lead of Benjamin Franklin, John
Dickinson and George Washington?</p>

<p><i>Never in the world.</i></p>

<p>Not until Patrick Henry and Dabney Carr and Thomas Jefferson
and James Otis and John Adams and Alexander Hamilton,
<i>the hot-headed young lawyers</i>, had fired the woods, and the
flames were leaping onward with a rush which none could stop,
did those more cautious and conservative citizens, Franklin, Dickinson
and Washington, commit themselves to the movement of the
Colonies against the Mother Country.</p>

<p>The lawyer lit the signal fires of that Revolution, the lawyer
wrote the Declaration of Independence, the lawyer framed the
Constitution, the lawyer organized the Government. The lawyer<span class="pagenum" id="Page102">[102]</span>
struck down Feudalism in America, wrote the statute for Religious
Liberty, swung wide the doors of individual opportunity, and
forged, ready for use, every weapon against tyranny which a
free people need to protect themselves from oppression.</p>

<p>Even at that early period there was another side to the shield,
not so bright as that which I have presented, but, throughout the
Revolutionary Era, the patriotic service of the lawyer was so
splendidly conspicuous that the reverse side of the shield was as
the spot on the sun.</p>

<p>When Andrew Jackson rode into Salisbury, N. C. (1785), and
put up at the Rowan House, the old-fashioned tavern, he was
eighteen years old, and had already gone to the school of experience,
to an extent which few of his future competitors for national
honor had equaled.</p>

<p>His boyhood had breathed in the hot atmosphere of war. The
sound of musketry, of rifle fire, of cannon play, had been familiar
to his ear. The sight of bloodshed, scenes of carnage, the ruthless
deeds of Tory hate and Whig revenge had burnt their impressions
upon mind and heart. The dangers amid which he had lived,
the hardships which he had endured, the lust of victory and the
panic of defeat, the sudden flight from the deadly attack, the narrow
escape from awful death, the loss of his brothers and mother,
the imprisonment and maltreatment of himself, the wild disorders
and appalling cruelties of foreign invasion added to Civil
strife&mdash;all these things were factors in the molding of Andrew
Jackson.</p>

<p>When he entered the office of Spruce McCay to read law under
that influential attorney, he had already given evidence of
the traits of character which afterward made him one of the
best loved and best hated men that ever lived.</p>

<p>It had already been shown that he would fight at the drop of a
hat; that he was headstrong, impatient of contradiction, and
overbearing. Weaker boys who turned to him for protection got
it. He would &#8220;take up&#8221; for the small boy, and, if need were,
wage his battle. He was high-tempered, quick as powder, hard
to get along with&mdash;and the boy who laughed at him because he
had what was called &#8220;a slobber mouth&#8221; had to run or fight.</p>

<p>He had shown that he was fond of outdoor life, outdoor sport
games, and recreations. He loved to hunt, was a good shot, an
expert horseman and rode admirably, excelled in running and
jumping. Some say that even when thrown by a stronger man
he &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t stay throwed&#8221;; others relate that John Lewis could
out-jump him and throw him down; and that when John Lewis
threw him, Andy <i>did</i> &#8220;stay throwed.&#8221; That he was believed to
have a generous nature is proven by the fact that he is said to
have been a great friend to this same John Lewis.</p>

<p>The eighteen-year old Jackson had already shown his fondness
for gambling at cards, on chicken fights and horse races, on the
throw of a dicebox, on almost any sort of game or contest. He
was known also as a wild young fellow who would drink too much
whisky, indulge in too many coarse practical jokes, and who,
when inflamed by anger, could out-curse anybody in all the regions
round about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span></p>

<p>During his stay of two years in Salisbury Jackson&#8217;s character
continued to unfold itself along those lines. He was not
much of a student; it is not recorded that he did any office work
for Spruce McCay; nor does any biographer explain how it was
that he paid for his board and lodging.</p>

<p>It seems that he kept his horse, and that he was active in
horse-racing, cock-fighting, card-playing circles; but it is not
probable that he relied upon his winnings to pay his way.</p>

<p>How, then, did he do it?</p>

<p>Perhaps his work as school-teacher should be assigned to this
period of his life, and it is possible that some remnant of his
legacy may have tided him over.</p>

<p>Illustrative of the rougher side of his character is the practical
joke which he played upon the eminent respectabilities of
Salisbury by sending cards of invitation to the Christmas ball to
two notorious strumpets of the town. The unclean birds came to
the ball, as per Andrew Jackson&#8217;s cards, and the uproar in the
fowl-house was considerable. But Andy was a great favorite
with the ladies&mdash;as &#8220;wild&#8221; young men have ever been&mdash;and he
succeeded in getting rid of the disturbers and at the same time
holding the admiration of the eminently respectable.</p>

<p>Another anecdote of the period represents him engaged with
boon companions in a carousal, which lasted throughout the night
and wound up with a general smashing of all the furniture in
the room.</p>

<p>A flood of light is poured upon his standing with the &#8220;unco&#8217;
good and rigidly righteous&#8221; at this time by the exclamation of
the old lady of Salisbury, who, on being told, forty years later,
that Andrew Jackson was a candidate for President, cried out:</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Jackson up for President? <i>Jackson?</i> <i>Andrew</i>
Jackson? The Jackson that used to live in Salisbury? Why,
when he was here, he was such a rake that my husband would
not bring him into the house! It is true, he <i>might</i> have taken
him out to the stable to weigh horses for a race, and might drink
a glass of whisky with him <i>there</i>. Well, if Andrew Jackson can
be President, anybody can.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the office of Judge Spruce McCay Jackson went to that
of Colonel John Stokes, where he continued his studies until he
thought himself ready for admission to the Bar. In the spring
of 1787 he applied for and received his license to practice law.</p>

<p>For a year after his admission to the Bar he appears to have
lived at a village in Martinsville, N. C., where two friends of his
kept a store. Tradition says that he helped them in running the
business, and that he accepted a local position as constable or
deputy-sheriff. At any rate, he realized soon that he was gaining
no foothold in North Carolina, and he made up his mind to try
his fortune in the new country beyond the mountains, where Robertson
and Donelson and Sevier were planting the beginning of
another state on the Cumberland.</p>

<p>Before we follow Jackson into Tennessee, let us pause &#8220;to
take his picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was tall and slender&mdash;standing six feet and one inch in
height. Carrying himself straight as a ramrod, and stepping<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>
with a quick, springing clearlift walk, he made the impression
upon the observer that he was as active as a cat&mdash;lithe, sinewy,
tough, and with not a lazy bone in his body.</p>

<p>He had a shock of red hair, and a pair of fine blue eyes, which
rested unwinkingly upon one in conversation, and which blazed
when he was aroused. His face was sallow, freckled, long, thin,
angular, with a fighting jaw.</p>

<p>His bearing toward men was open, frank, confident, self-assertive.</p>

<p>Toward women he was deferential, most attentive and polite.
Surprising as it may seem, there is no room for doubt that Andrew
Jackson&#8217;s manner toward ladies was from the first, captivating
to a marked degree. By the time he reached the age of
eighteen he had developed a taste for good dressing. The same
trait which led him to want the finest-looking horse, the richest
caparison, the best pistols and guns, the best dogs and game
chickens, led him to choose for himself a style of wearing
apparel, both in the material and the make, which was far above
the average of the backwoods.</p>

<p>Some of his lady friends went to the courthouse the day he
was examined for admission to the Bar, and one of these has left
a description of him as he then appeared.</p>

<p>Those who recall Albert Gallatin&#8217;s statement that Jackson,
when in Congress, looked and dressed like an uncouth backwoodsman
may not be able to reconcile his testimony with that of Mrs.
Anne Rutherford, who says:</p>

<p>&#8220;He always dressed neat and tidy, and carried himself as if he
was a rich man&#8217;s son.</p>

<p>&#8220;The day he was licensed he had on a new suit, with a broadcloth
coat, ruffled shirt, and other garments in the best of fashion.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is no disputing about taste; and the reader is left to
the conclusion that a style of dressing which appeared to be the
best of fashion to a country girl of North Carolina may have
seemed &#8220;irregular&#8221; to such a cosmopolitan gentleman as Gallatin.</p>

<p>The red breeches of Thomas Jefferson had been &#8220;the best of
fashion&#8221; in Paris, but when he wore them in New York, as a
member of Washington&#8217;s Cabinet, social rumblings were heard
and social upheavals feared.</p>

<p class="dropcapp"><img src="images/dropcapa.jpg" alt="A" width="88" height="100" class="dropcapi" /><span class="noshow">A</span>
young man was
walking up and down
the waiting room of a
railway station, in an
agitated condition. He
wore blue spectacles,
and, although he had
not a cold, he used his
pocket-handkerchief incessantly. He
held a little black bag in his left hand
which, as I learned later, contained a
silk dressing-gown and a pair of Turkish
pantaloons.</p>

<p>Every now and again he went to
the door and looked into the street,
then he drew out his watch and consulted
the station clock. The train
did not leave for an hour; but there
are people who always imagine they
will be late. This train was not for
people in a pressing hurry; there were
very few first-class carriages in it. It
was not an hour at which stock-brokers
left, after business was finished, to
go to their country homes for dinner.
When travellers began to appear, a
Parisian would have recognized from
their bearing that they were either
farmers, or small suburban tradesmen.
Nevertheless, every time anyone
came into the station, or a carriage
drew up at the door, the
heart of the young man with the blue
spectacles became inflated like a balloon,
his knees trembled, his bag
almost fell from his hands, and his
glasses off his nose, where, we may
mention in passing, they were seated
crookedly.</p>

<p>His agitation increased when, after
a long wait, a woman appeared by a
side door, from precisely the direction
in which he had kept a constant lookout.
She was dressed in black with a
thick veil over her face, and she held
a brown morocco leather bag in her
hand, containing, as I subsequently
discovered, a wondrous morning-gown
and blue satin slippers. The woman
and the young man advanced towards
each other looking to right and left,
but never in front of them. They
came up to one another, shook hands,
and stood several minutes without
speaking a word, trembling and gasping,
a prey to one of those intense
emotions for which I would give in
exchange a hundred years of a philosopher&#8217;s
life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leon,&#8221; said the young woman,
when she had summoned up courage
to speak (I had forgotten to mention
that she was young and pretty)&mdash;&#8220;Leon,
what a happy thought! I
should never have recognized you with
those blue spectacles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a happy thought!&#8221; said
Leon. &#8220;I should never have known
you under that black veil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a happy thought!&#8221; she
repeated. &#8220;Let us be quick to take
our seats; suppose the train were to
start without us!...&#8221; (and she
squeezed his arm tightly). &#8220;No one
will suspect us. I am now with Clara
and her husband, on the way to their
country house, where, <i>tomorrow</i>, I
must say good-bye to her; ...
and,&#8221; she added, laughing and lowering
her head, &#8220;she left an hour ago;<span class="pagenum" id="Page106">[106]</span>
and tomorrow, ... after passing
<i>the last evening</i> with her, ...
(again she pressed his arm), tomorrow
in the morning, she will leave me at
the station, where I shall meet Ursula,
whom I sent on ahead to my aunt&#8217;s....
Oh! I have arranged everything.
Let us take our tickets.... They
cannot possibly guess who we
are. Oh! suppose they ask our names
at the inn? I have forgotten them
already....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur and Madame Duru.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no! Not Duru. There was a
shoemaker called that at the pension.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dumont, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Daumont.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. But no one will ask
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bell rang, the door of the waiting-room
opened, and the carefully
veiled young woman rushed into a
carriage with her youthful companion.
The bell rang a second time, and
the door of their compartment was
closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are alone!&#8221; they exclaimed
delightedly.</p>

<p>But, almost at the same moment, a
man of about fifty, dressed completely
in black, with a grave and bored
expression, entered the carriage and
settled himself in a corner. The
engine whistled, and the train began
to move. The two young people drew
back as far as they could from their
unwelcome neighbor and began to
whisper in English as an additional
precaution.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur,&#8221; said the other traveller,
in the same tongue, and with a
much purer British accent, &#8220;if you
have secrets to tell each other, you
had better not tell them in English
before me, for I am an Englishman.
I am extremely sorry to annoy you;
but there was only a single man in the
other compartment, and I make it a
rule never to travel alone with one
man only.... He had the face of a
Judas and this might have tempted
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed to his travelling-bag,
which he had thrown before him on
the cushion.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I shall read if I do not go to
sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, indeed, he did make a gallant
effort to sleep. He opened his bag,
drew out a comfortable cap, put it on
his head, and kept his eyes shut for
several minutes; then he reopened
them with a gesture of impatience,
searched in his bag for his spectacles,
then for a Greek book. At length he
settled himself to read, with an air of
deep attention. While getting his book
out of the bag he displaced many
things piled up hap-hazard. Among
others, he drew out of the depths of
the bag a large bundle of Bank of
England notes, placed it on the seat
opposite him, and, before putting it
back in the bag, he showed it to the
young man, and asked him if there
was a place in N&mdash;&mdash; where he could
change banknotes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably, as it is on the route to
England.&#8221;</p>

<p>N&mdash;&mdash; was the place to which the
young people were going. There is
quite a tidy little hotel at N&mdash;&mdash;,
where people seldom stop except on
Saturday evenings. It is held out
that the rooms are good, but the host
and his helpers are far enough away
from Paris to indulge in this provincial
vice. The young man whom I
have already called by the name of
Leon, had been recommended to this
hotel some time previously, when he
was minus blue spectacles, and, upon
his recommendation, his companion
and friend had seemed desirous of
visiting it.</p>

<p>She was, moreover, at that time in
such a condition of mind that the
walls of a prison would have seemed
delightful, if they had enclosed Leon
with her.</p>

<p>In the meantime the train journeyed
on; the Englishman read his
Greek book, without looking towards
his companions, who conversed in that
low tone that only lovers can hear.<span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span>
Perhaps I shall not astonish my
readers when I tell them that these
two were lovers in the fullest acceptation
of the term, and what was still
more deplorable, they were not married,
because there were reasons
which placed an obstacle in the way of
their desire.</p>

<p>They reached N&mdash;&mdash;, and the Englishman
got out first. Whilst Leon
helped his friend to descend from the
carriage without showing her legs, a
man jumped on to the platform
from the next compartment. He
was pale, even sallow; his eyes
were sunken and bloodshot, and his
beard unkempt, a sign by which great
criminals are often detected. His
dress was clean, but worn almost
threadbare. His coat, once black, but
now grey at the back and by the
elbows, was buttoned up to his chin,
probably to hide a waistcoat still more
shabby. He went up to the Englishman
and put on a deferential tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave me alone, you wretch!&#8221;
cried the Englishman, whose grey eyes
flashed with anger; and he took a step
forward to leave the station.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t drive me to despair,&#8221; replied
the other, with a piteous and
yet at the same time menacing accent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you be good enough to hold
my bag for a moment?&#8221; said the old
Englishman, throwing his travelling-bag
at Leon&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>He then took the man who had
accosted him by the arm, and led, or
rather pushed, him into a corner,
where he hoped they would not be
overheard, and there he seemed to address
him roughly for a moment. He
then drew some papers from his
pocket, crumpled them up, and put
them in the hand of the man who had
called him uncle. The latter took the
papers without offering any thanks,
and almost immediately took himself
off and disappeared.</p>

<p>As there is but one hotel in N&mdash;&mdash; it
was not surprising that, after a short
interval, all the characters of this
veracious story met together there. In
France every traveller who has the
good fortune to have a well-dressed
wife on his arm is certain to obtain the
best room in any hotel; so firmly is it
believed that we are the politest nation
in Europe.</p>

<p>If the bedroom that was assigned to
Leon was the best, it would be rash
to conclude that it was perfect. It
had a great walnut bedstead, with
chintz curtains, on which was printed
in violet the magic story of Pyramis
and Thisbe. The walls were covered
with a colored paper representing a
view of Naples and a multitude of
people; unfortunately, idle and impertinent
visitors had drawn moustaches
and pipes to all the figures,
both male and female, and many silly
things had been scribbled in lead-pencil
in rhyme and prose on the sky
and ocean. Upon this background
hung several engravings: &#8220;Louis
Philippe taking the Oath of the Charter
of 1830,&#8221; &#8220;The first Interview
between Julia and Saint-Preux,&#8221;
&#8220;Waiting for Happiness,&#8221; and &#8220;Regrets,&#8221;
after M. Dubuffe. This room
was called the Blue Chamber, because
the two arm-chairs to left and right
of the fireplace were upholstered in
Utrecht velvet of that color; but for a
number of years they had been covered
with wrappers of grey glazed
calico edged with red braid.</p>

<p>Whilst the hotel servants crowded
round the new arrival and offered
their services, Leon, who, although in
love, was not destitute of common
sense, went to order dinner. It required
all his eloquence and various
kinds of bribes to extract the promise
of a dinner by themselves alone.
Great was his dismay when he learnt
that in the principal dining-room,
which was next his room, the officers
of the 3rd Hussars, who were about
to relieve the officers of the 3rd Chasseurs
at N&mdash;&mdash;, were going to join at
a farewell dinner that very day, which
would be a lively affair. The host
swore by all his gods that, except a<span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span>
certain amount of gaiety which was
natural to every French soldier, the
officers of the Hussars and Chasseurs
were known throughout the town for
their gentlemanly and discreet behavior,
and that their proximity
would not inconvenience madam in the
least; the officers were in the habit
of rising from table before midnight.</p>

<p>As Leon went back to the Blue
Chamber but slightly reassured, he
noticed that the Englishman occupied
the other room next his. The door
was open, and the Englishman sat at
a table upon which were a glass and
a bottle. He was looking at the ceiling
with profound attention, as though he
were counting the flies walking on it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What matter if they are so near,&#8221;
said Leon to himself. &#8220;The Englishman
will soon be tipsy, and the Hussars
will leave before midnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>On entering the Blue Chamber his
first care was to make sure that the
communicating doors were tightly
locked, and that they had bolts to
them. There were double doors on
the Englishman&#8217;s side, and the walls
were thick. The partition was thinner
on the Hussars&#8217; side, but the door had
a lock and a bolt. After all, this was
a more effectual barrier to curiosity
than the blinds of a carriage, and how
many people think they are hidden
from the world in a hackney carriage!</p>

<p>Assuredly the most opulent imagination
could certainly never have pictured
a more complete state of happiness
than that of these two young
lovers, who, after waiting so long,
found themselves alone and far away
from jealous and prying eyes, preparing
to relate their past sufferings at
their ease and to taste the delights of
a perfect reunion. But the devil
always finds out a way to pour his
drop of wormwood into the cup of
happiness.</p>

<p>Johnson was not the first who wrote&mdash;he
took it from a Greek writer&mdash;that
no man could say, &#8220;Today I shall
be happy.&#8221; This truth was recognized
at a very remote period by the
greatest philosophers, and yet is
ignored by a certain number of mortals,
and especially by most lovers.</p>

<p>Whilst taking a poorly served dinner
in the Blue Chamber from some
dishes filched from the Hussars&#8217; and
the Chasseurs&#8217; banquet, Leon and his
lover were much disturbed by the
conversation in which the gentlemen
in the neighboring room were engaged.
They held forth on abstruse
subjects concerning strategy and
tactics, which I shall refrain from
repeating.</p>

<p>There were a succession of wild
stories&mdash;nearly all of them broad and
accompanied by shrieks of laughter,
in which it was often difficult for our
lovers not to join. Leon&#8217;s friend was
no prude; but there are things one
prefers not to hear, particularly during
a tete-a-tete with the man one
loves. The situation became more and
more embarrassing, and when they
were taking in the officers&#8217; dessert,
Leon felt he must go downstairs to
beg the host to tell the gentlemen that
he had an invalid wife in the room
adjoining theirs, and they would
deem it a matter of courtesy if a little
less noise were made.</p>

<p>The noise was nothing out of the
way for a regimental dinner, and the
host was taken aback and did not
know what to reply. Just when Leon
gave his message for the officers, a
waiter asked for champagne for the
Hussars, and a maidservant for port
wine for the Englishman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him there was none,&#8221; she
added.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a fool. I have every kind
of wine. I will go and find him some.
Port is it? Bring me the bottle of
ratafia, a bottle of quince and a small
decanter of brandy.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the host had concocted the
port in a trice, he went into the large
dining-room to execute Leon&#8217;s commission,
which at first roused a furious
storm.</p>

<p>Then a deep voice, which dominated
all the others, asked what kind of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span>
woman their neighbor was. There
was a brief silence before the host
replied&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, gentlemen, I do not know
how to answer you. She is very pretty
and very shy. Marie-Jeanne says she
has a wedding ring on her finger. She
is probably a bride come here on her
honeymoon, as so many others come
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A bride?&#8221; exclaimed forty voices.
&#8220;She must come and clink glasses with
us! We will drink to her health and
teach the husband his conjugal
duties!&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words there was a great
jingling of spurs, and our lovers trembled,
fearing that their room was
about to be taken by storm. All at
once a voice was raised which stopped
the man&#339;uvre. It evidently belonged
to a commanding officer. He reproached
the officers with their want
of politeness, ordered them to sit down
again and to talk decently, without
shouting. Then he added some
words too low to be heard in the Blue
Chamber. He was listened to with
deference, but, nevertheless, not without
exciting a certain amount of
covert hilarity. From that moment
there was comparative quiet in the
officers&#8217; room; and our lovers, blessing
the salutary reign of discipline,
began to talk together with more freedom....
But after such confusion
it was a little time before they
regained that peace of mind which
anxiety, the worries of travelling, and,
worse than all, the loud merriment of
their neighbors, had so greatly agitated.
This was not very difficult to
accomplish, however, at their age, and
they had very soon forgotten all the
troubles of their adventurous expedition
in thinking of its more important
consequences.</p>

<p>They thought peace was declared
with the Hussars. Alas! it was but
a truce. Just when they expected it
least, when they were a thousand
leagues away from this sublunary
world, twenty-four trumpets, supported
by several trombones, struck
up the air well known to French
soldiers, &#8220;La victoire est nous!&#8221; How
could anyone withstand such a tempest?
The poor lovers might well
complain.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>But they had not much longer to
complain, for at the end the officers
left the dining-room, filed past the
door of the Blue Chamber with a great
clattering of spurs and sabres, and
shouted one after the other&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night, madam bride!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then all noise ceased. No, I am
mistaken; the Englishman came out
into the passage and cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waiter! bring me another bottle
of the same port.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quiet was restored in the hotel of
N&mdash;&mdash;. The night was fine and the
moon at the full. From time immemorial
lovers have been pleased to
gaze at our satellite. Leon and his
lover opened their window, which
looked on a small garden, and
breathed with delight the fresh air,
which was filled with the scent of a
bower of clematis.</p>

<p>They had not looked long, however,
before a man came to walk in the
garden. His head was bowed, his
arms crossed, and he had a cigar in
his mouth, Leon thought he recognized
the nephew of the Englishman
who was fond of good port wine.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>I dislike useless details, and besides,
I do not feel called upon to tell the
reader things he can readily imagine,
nor to relate all that happened hour
by hour in the inn at N&mdash;&mdash;. I will
merely say that the candle which
burned on the fireless mantle-piece of
the Blue Chamber was more than half
consumed when a strange sound issued
from the Englishman&#8217;s room, in which
there had been silence until now; it
was like the fall of a heavy body. To
this noise was added a kind of cracking,
quite as odd, followed by a
smothered cry and several inarticulate
words like an oath. The two young<span class="pagenum" id="Page110">[110]</span>
occupants of the Blue Chamber shuddered.
Perhaps they had been waked
up suddenly by it. The noise seemed
a sinister one to both of them, for
they could not explain it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our friend the Englishman is
dreaming,&#8221; said Leon, trying to force
a smile.</p>

<p>But although he wanted to reassure
his companion, he shivered involuntarily.
Two or three minutes afterwards
a door in the corridor opened
cautiously, as it seemed, then closed
very quietly. They heard a slow and
unsteady footstep which appeared to
be trying to disguise its gait.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a cursed inn!&#8221; exclaimed
Leon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, it is a paradise!&#8221; replied the
young woman, letting her head fall
on Leon&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;I am dead
with sleep....&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed, and was very soon fast
asleep again.</p>

<p>A famous moralist has said that
men are never garrulous when they
have all their heart&#8217;s desire. It is
not surprising, therefore, that Leon
made no further attempt to renew the
conversation or to discourse upon
the noises in the hotel at N&mdash;&mdash;.
Nevertheless, he was preoccupied, and
his imagination pieced together many
events to which in another mood he
would have paid no attention. The
evil countenance of the Englishman&#8217;s
nephew returned to his memory.
There was hatred in the look that he
threw at his uncle even while he spoke
humbly to him, doubtless because he
was asking for money.</p>

<p>What would be easier than for a
man, still young and vigorous, and
desperate besides, to climb from the
garden to the window of the next
room? Moreover, he was staying at
the hotel, and would walk in the garden
after dark, perhaps ... quite
possibly ... undoubtedly, he knew
that his uncle&#8217;s black bag contained
a thick bundle of bank-notes....
And that heavy blow, like the blow
of a club on a bald head! ... that
stifled cry! ... that fearful oath!
and those steps afterwards! That
nephew looked like an assassin....
But people do not assassinate in a
hotel full of officers. Surely the
Englishman, like a wise man, had
locked himself in, specially knowing
the rogue was about.... He
evidently mistrusted him, since he
had not wished to accost him bag
in hand.... But why allow such
hideous thoughts when one is so
happy?</p>

<p>Thus did Leon cogitate to himself.
In the midst of his thoughts, which I
will refrain from analyzing at greater
length, and which passed in his mind
like so many confused dreams, he
fixed his eyes mechanically on the door
of communication between the Blue
Chamber and the Englishman&#8217;s room.</p>

<p>In France, doors fit badly. Between
this one and the floor there was
a space of nearly an inch. Suddenly,
from this space, which was hardly
lighted by the reflection from the polished
floor, there appeared something
blackish and flat, like a knife blade,
for the edge which the candlelight
caught showed a thin line which shone
brightly. It moved slowly in the
direction of a little blue-satin slipper,
which had been carelessly thrown
close to this door. Was it some insect
like a centipede?... No, it was no
insect. It had no definite shape....
Two or three brown streams, each with
its line of light on its edges, had come
through into the room. Their pace
quickened, for the floor was a sloaping
one.... They came on rapidly and
touched the little slipper. There was
no longer any doubt! It was a liquid,
and that liquid, the color of which
could now be distinctly seen by the
candlelight, was blood! While Leon,
paralyzed with horror, watched these
frightful streams, the young woman
slept on peacefully, her regular
breathing warming her lover&#8217;s neck
and shoulder.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>The care which Leon had taken in<span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span>
ordering the dinner on their arrival
at the inn of N&mdash;&mdash; adequately proved
that he had a pretty level head, a high
degree of intelligence and that he
could look ahead. He did not in this
emergency belie the character we have
already indicated. He did not stir,
and the whole strength of his mind
was strained to keep this resolve in
the presence of the frightful disaster
which threatened him.</p>

<p>I can imagine that most of my
readers, and, above all, my lady
readers, filled with heroic sentiments,
will blame the conduct of Leon on this
occasion for remaining motionless.
They will tell me he ought to have
rushed to the Englishman&#8217;s room and
arrested the murderer, or, at least, to
have pulled his bell and rung up the
people of the hotel. To this I reply
that, in the first case, the bells in
French inns are only room ornaments,
and their cords do not correspond to
any metallic apparatus. I would add
respectfully, but decidedly, that, if
it is wrong to leave an Englishman to
die close by one, it is not praiseworthy
to sacrifice for him a woman who is
sleeping with her head on your
shoulder. What would have happened
if Leon had made an uproar and
roused the hotel? The police, the
inspector and his assistant would have
come at once. These gentlemen are
by profession so curious, that, before
asking him what he had seen or heard,
they would have questioned him as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name? Where are
your papers? And what about
Madame? What were you doing
together in the Blue Chamber? You
will have to appear at the Assizes to
explain the exact month, at what hour
in the night, you were witnesses of
this deed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now it was precisely this thought of
the inspector and officers of the law
which first occurred to Leon&#8217;s mind.
Everywhere throughout life there are
questions of conscience difficult to
solve. Is it better to allow an
unknown traveller to have his throat
cut, or to disgrace and lose the woman
one loves?</p>

<p>It is unpleasant to have to propose
such a problem. I defy the cleverest
person to solve it.</p>

<p>Leon did then what probably most
would have done in his place. He
never moved.</p>

<p>He remained fascinated for a long
time with his eyes fixed upon the blue
slipper and the little red stream which
touched it. A cold sweat moistened
his temples, and his heart beat in his
breast as though it would burst.</p>

<p>A host of thoughts and strange and
horrible fancies took possession of
him, and an inward voice cried out all
the time, &#8220;In an hour all will be
known, and it is your own fault!&#8221;
Nevertheless, by dint of repeating to
himself &#8220;Qu&#8217;allais-je faire dens cette
galere?&#8221; he finished up by perceiving
some few rays of hope. &#8220;If we
leave this accursed hotel,&#8221; he said to
himself at last, &#8220;before the discovery
of what has happened in the adjoining
room, perhaps they may lose trace
of us. No one knows us here. I
have only been seen in blue
spectacles, and she has only been seen
in a veil. We are only two steps
from the station, and should be far
away from it in an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, as he had studied the time-table
at great length to make out his
journey, he recollected that the train
for Paris stopped at eight o&#8217;clock.
Very soon afterward they would be
lost in the vastness of that town,
where so many guilty persons are concealed.
Who could discover two innocent
people there? But would
they not go into the Englishman&#8217;s
room before eight o&#8217;clock? That
was the vital question.</p>

<p>Quite convinced that there was no
other course before him, he made a
desperate effort to shake off the torpor
which had taken possession of him
for so long, but at the first movement
he made his young companion woke
up and kissed him half-consciously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span>
At the touch of his icy cheek she
uttered a little cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; she said
to him anxiously. &#8220;Your forehead
is as cold as marble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is nothing,&#8221; he replied in a
voice which belied his words. &#8220;I
heard a noise in the next room....&#8221;</p>

<p>He freed himself from her arms,
then he moved the blue slipper and
put an armchair in front of the door
of communication, so as to hide the
horrid liquid from his lover&#8217;s eyes.
It had stopped flowing, and had now
collected into quite a big pool on the
floor. Then he half opened the door
which led to the passage, and listened
attentively. He even ventured to go
up to the Englishman&#8217;s door, which
was closed. There were already
stirrings in the hotel, for day had begun.
The stablemen were grooming
the horses in the yard, and an officer
came downstairs from the second
story, clinking his spurs. He was on
his way to preside at that interesting
piece of work, more agreeable to
horses than to men, which is technically
known as <i>la botte</i>.</p>

<p>Leon re-entered the Blue Chamber,
and, with every precaution that love
could invent, with the help of much
circumlocution and many euphemisms
he revealed their situation to his
friend.</p>

<p>It was dangerous to stay and
dangerous to leave too precipitately;
still much more dangerous to wait at
the hotel until the catastrophe in the
next room was discovered.</p>

<p>There is no need to describe the
terror caused by this communication,
or the tears which followed it, the
senseless suggestions which were advanced,
or how many times the two
unhappy young people flung themselves
into each other&#8217;s arms, saying,
&#8220;Forgive me! forgive me!&#8221; Each
took the blame. They voiced to die
together, for the young woman did
not doubt that the law would find
them guilty of the murder of
the Englishman, and as they were not
sure that they would be allowed to
embrace each other again on the
scaffold they did it now to suffocation,
and vied with each other in watering
themselves with tears. At length,
after having talked much rubbish and
exchanged many tender and harrowing
words, they decided, in the midst
of a thousand kisses, that the plan
thought out by Leon, to leave by the
eight o&#8217;clock train, was really the only
one practicable, and the best to
follow. But there were still two
mortal hours to get through. At
each step in the corridor they trembled
in every limb. Each creak of
boots proclaimed the arrival of the inspector.</p>

<p>Their small packing was done in a
flash. The young woman wanted to
burn the blue slipper in the fireplace;
but Leon picked it up and, after wiping
it by the bedside, he kissed it and
put it in his pocket. He was
astonished to find that it smelt of
vanilla, though his lover&#8217;s perfume
was &#8220;Bouquet de l&#8217;Imperatrice
Eugenie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everybody in the hotel was now
awake. They heard the laughing of
waiters, servant-girls singing at their
work, and soldiers brushing their officers&#8217;
clothes. Seven o&#8217;clock had just
struck. Leon wanted to make his
friend drink a cup of coffee, but she
declared that her throat was so choked
up that she should die if she tried to
drink anything.</p>

<p>Leon, armed with the blue spectacles,
went down to pay the bill.
The host begged his pardon for the
noise that had been made; he could
not at all understand it, for the officers
were always so quiet! Leon
assured him that he had heard nothing,
but had slept profoundly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think your neighbor on
the other side would inconvenience
you,&#8221; continued the landlord; &#8220;he
did not make much noise. I bet he
is still sleeping soundly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leon leant hard against the desk to
keep from falling, and the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span>
woman, who had followed him closely,
clutched at his arm and tightened
the veil over her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a swell,&#8221; added the pitiless
host. &#8220;He will have the best of
everything. Ah! he is a good sort.
But all the English are not like him.
There was one here who is a skinflint.
He thought everything too dear; his
room, his dinner. He wanted me to
take a five-pound Bank of England
note in settlement of his bill for one
hundred and eighty-five francs, ...
and to risk whether it was a good
one! But stop, Monsieur; perhaps
you will know, for I heard you talking
English with Madam.... Is it a
good one?&#8221;</p>

<p>With these words he showed Leon
a five-pound bank-note. On one of
its corners there was a little spot of
red which Leon could readily explain
to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is quite good,&#8221; he said
in a stifled voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you have plenty of time,&#8221; replied
the host; &#8220;the train is not due
here till eight o&#8217;clock, and it is always
late. Will you not sit down, Madam?
You seem tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment a fat servant-girl
came up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hot water, quick,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for
milord&#8217;s tea. Give me a sponge, too.
He has broken a bottle of wine and
the whole room is flooded.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words Leon fell into a
chair, and his companion did the same
An intense desire to laugh overtook
them both, and they had the greatest
difficulty in restraining themselves.
The young woman squeezed his hand
joyfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we will not go until the
two o&#8217;clock train,&#8221; said Leon to the
landlord. &#8220;Let us have a good meal
at midday.&#8221;</p>

<h2>The Lake of The Dismal Swamp.</h2>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="dropcapp"><img src="images/dropcapa.jpg" alt="A" width="88" height="100" class="dropcapi" /><span class="noshow">A</span>t
an early day in the
history of our Nation,
there had emigrated to
the Southeastern shore
of the Old Dominion,
an English gentleman,
whose manners and
carriage bespoke aristocratic
lineage, and whose free use
of money made it evident to those
in the same locality, that he must have
been a man of parts in the country
whence he had come.</p>

<p>He had bought up acres and acres
of the land lying contiguous to the
Dismal Swamp, but occupied a hewn
log house some miles distant from that
place of ill repute. The report gained
credence that he had left the Old
Country &#8220;for the good of his health,&#8221;
in other words, his knowledge of and
participation in the plots and counter-plots
against the government, made it
safer for both himself and some, whose
fingers had ever held the pulse of the
Nation, that he should live elsewhere;
and we find him making himself a
home across the waters, with stint of
nothing, for a vessel never made harbor,
that it did not bring a large consignment
to Theodore Stanton.</p>

<p>In the course of time he erected for
himself and family a commodious
house, many of the necessary materials
coming from abroad, and he was ever
ready to welcome to his board any
wayfarer with whom he came in contact.</p>

<p>It was during the time that his
house was building, and he had been
scouring the country for help for the
work, when one day, a young Indian
boy presented himself at his door asking,
&#8220;Work for me do?&#8221; He spoke
very indifferent English, but Mr.
Stanton understood he had come in
response to his inquiries for hands,
and he asked, &#8220;What can you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ride horse, shoot gun, hunt deer.&#8221;</p>

<p>His appearance appealed to Mr.
Stanton, and he nodded his head saying,
&#8220;You can hunt deer and bear for
me, eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>That seemed satisfactory and from
that time on, he called Mr. Stanton&#8217;s,
home, and sure enough supplied the
family with all the game they could
use.</p>

<p>But his especial attention seemed to
be paid to Mr. Stanton&#8217;s little girl,
Alice, to whom he was devoted, and
who never seemed so happy or contented,
as when perched on Powhatan&#8217;s
shoulders and scouring the country
for flowers, nuts or berries. He
had been at his chosen home now, for
a long time, and had learned to speak
and understand our tongue very well.
He said he was descended from old
Chief Powhatan and that little Pocahontas
was his kin, but that his
father had been badly treated and
set aside and would not go with his
tribe of Indians; but if any questions
were asked, as to where his
father was, a stolid look would settle<span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span>
over his countenance, and he would
make no reply; occasionally he would
disappear, and be gone for a day or
two, but always came back, ready for
his appointed duty, to hunt the meat
for Mr. Stanton. He was as straight
as an arrow, and it required little
imagination to believe he might be
descended from a line of kings, his
bearing was so dignified and regal.
To no one was he communicative or
unbending, save little Alice, over
whom he watched with jealous care.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stanton, Alice&#8217;s mother, had
never liked him, and often expressed
uneasiness at the feeling that seemed
to exist between her ewe lamb, and
this dusky son of the forest, and she
begged her husband to consign her
to her sister&#8217;s care, in England, in
that way breaking up the association,
and giving Alice, at the same time,
opportunities for education that she
would lack in the States.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, wife, don&#8217;t ask me that; I have
made sacrifices enough, God knows.
I cannot stand to be parted from my
little one; send for tutors, governesses
or any other sort of SSS, that you
want, I will bear all expense, but let
me see my dear daughter every day,
that&#8217;s a dear.&#8221; Mrs. Stanton said
no more, but she watched with ever
growing sorrow; the glow of pride
that came to Powhatan&#8217;s dark countenance,
when gazing at &#8220;Laughing
Water,&#8221; as he called Alice.</p>

<p>The gentle girl was now turning
sixteen, and had developed into great
loveliness, but seemed wholly unconscious
of her charms, and really I
believe, that was the one thing that
drew so many worshippers to her
shrine.</p>

<p>About this time a party of gentlemen
had arrived from old England,
looking at lands for the settlement of
some emigrants who were anxious to
throw in their fate with the new
settled country, and among them were
the sons of some of Mr. Stanton&#8217;s
early and close friends.</p>

<p>Frank Berkley, nephew of the ex-governor,
was among the number, and
soon won his way to the hearts of old
and young alike, by his kindliness
and sprightliness.</p>

<p>Alice seemed unusually lively, when
he was regaling her with his exploits
at college or his tilts with the fair
sex at home, and her merry laugh
would ring out at his bright wit or
mirthful sallies.</p>

<p>None seemed to observe the vengeful
scowls Powhatan would throw at
the jolly crowd, as he crossed and
recrossed the Hall, but would never
enter the parlor, nor join in any of the
sports. I said none&mdash;none save the
anxious mother, who ever had her
eye on her darling and when as a
great secret Alice confided to her, that
Frank wanted to take her across the
water with him as his bride, she
assented cheerfully, for she felt that
to be the only way to save her child
from some direful fate.</p>

<p>The party was going farther West,
making explorations, and would return
about Christmas time, to enjoy the
festivities of that season under Mr.
Stanton&#8217;s hospitable roof, and would
then take shipping for home. Farewells
were said, and all were well
on their way, but Frank lingered.
&#8220;Stay with us, Frank,&#8221; Alice said
tearfully, &#8220;we will be so lonely when
you are gone,&#8221; and Frank felt he
would willingly tear his heart out, if
it would comfort the little girl he had
grown to love so much in two months.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he said, &#8220;my darling, then I
would be accounted a laggard in duty,
for don&#8217;t you know I was put in
charge of this expedition; and will be
held strictly accountable for its failure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said, &#8220;Frank, forgive
me. I will not be such a baby. I know
you will soon be back, and I will try
to scare away the blues and bid you a
cheerful good-bye,&#8221; and he never forgot
to his dying day, how she put her
arms around his neck and kissed him
a fond farewell. The last echo
brought to him her parting words,<span class="pagenum" id="Page116">[116]</span>
&#8220;back soon.&#8221; They did not know that
an eye had watched their parting, and
the owner of that orb, had trembled
with rage when he witnessed the
caress.</p>

<p>Powhatan tried to coax her to ride
or row, and had made and painted
pure white, a little canoe for her, but
she told him it made her tired to use
the oars. &#8220;Come and see what a
beauty your boat is, Minnehaha; you
care no more for your poor Powhatan,&#8221;
he said sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I do,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;but I
worked so hard entertaining papa&#8217;s
friends, I must rest up, but I will see
the boat,&#8221; and taking his hand she
ran lightly to the barn, to see and
admire the little white canoe, with
places all around the top for lights to
be inserted, when the candles were lit
at night; it certainly made a beautiful
show. But his coaxing could not
induce her to go on the water in it,
and the craft was only rigged up to
show to her friends, and still remained
in Powhatan&#8217;s workshop. The mornings
were beginning to be frosty and
the air to show that the weeks had
passed along and soon now, they might
look for the return of the friends.
Wild turkeys were killed and dressed,
venison hams were baked and boiled,
and the array of cakes and pies in the
pantry, looked most tempting. On the
afternoon of the 23d of December, Mr.
Stanton was decorating the rooms,
under the supervision of his good
wife, and calling to Alice, said,
&#8220;Daughter, we do need some holly so
much, could you not take one of the
boys, and get some from the wood on
the swamp road? I must hie me to
the postoffice or would get it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Pop, I will take my pony
and John and soon be back.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she went out Powhatan met her,
and having heard what Mr. Stanton
said, begged to be allowed to accompany
her, saying, &#8220;I will take care of
you, Minnehaha.&#8221; So she could not
well refuse, and when he had saddled
her pony and old Thunder for himself,
they mounted and rode off.</p>

<p>The father returned with the mail,
the mother dressed for the evening
meal, but Alice came not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh father,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;where can
she be?&#8221; and the mother grew restless
and uneasy. Presently seeing John
approaching, Mr. Stanton called out,</p>

<p>&#8220;John, where is Miss Alice, boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, I didn&#8217;t go with her; she went
long that Injun, he say he take good
care of her.&#8221; Mrs. Stanton was
almost beside herself. Wringing her
hands, she begged her husband for
&#8220;God&#8217;s sake,&#8221; to take some of the men
and seek the child, ere she was lost in
the dreadful swamps. Searching parties
scoured the country all that night,
and when the next morning, Mr. Berkeley
and his friends arrived, they,
too, joined in the hunt, which was kept
up for a whole week, but nothing was
ever discovered, save Alice&#8217;s little
pony, quietly grazing on the edge of
the swamp.</p>

<p>A rumor came, that from the highest
point overlooking the Lake in the
Dismal Swamp, a huge black horse,
with two riders, was seen to jump
directly into the lake and never rose
again. From the same fisherman, who
dwelt on some high knoll in the swamp
the report was scattered far and wide,
that at 10 o&#8217;clock every bright night
was seen a little white canoe, lit with
firefly lamps, pushed swiftly through
the waters of the lake by a beautiful
girl with fair locks floating over her
shoulders.</p>

<p>The story was that she crossed the
lake and then disappeared in the dark
woods beyond. But nothing was ever
seen or heard of Alice or her dusky
lover again. Mrs. Stanton took to her
bed and died of a broken heart, leaving
young Berkley to care for the
stricken old man, who was soon laid
beside her in the garden that had been
sweet Alice&#8217;s playground. Mr. Stanton
left everything he had to Frank
Berkley who mourned sincerely for his
lost love.</p>

<h3 class="question">Various Phases of the Money
Question.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><i>Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Thomson,
Ga.</i>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;Your logical editorial
in your October magazine under the
caption of &#8220;The Money Changer and
the Politician&#8221; hit the bull&#8217;s eye and
went straight to the heart of the subject.
I heartily endorse the editorial.
Hon. A. S. J. S&mdash;&mdash;, a very able and
conservative gentleman and also a
gold bug as we sometimes denominate
them, takes issue with you, as to some
of your assertions, and as the Doctor
is a subscriber to your magazine and
very much open to conviction I am
led, as a result of a pleasant discussion
with him to ask you some questions
on said editorial for the purpose
of drawing you out more fully on the
subject for the Doctor&#8217;s special benefit
and for general light on the money
question.</p>

<p>The questions that I propound embody
the objections of the Doctor to
what he otherwise concedes to be an
able elaboration of the question under
discussion.</p>

<p>You say, &#8220;Sparta rose to be a state
of the first class on a currency of
iron; Rome became Mistress of the
World on legal tender copper; coined
silver did not come into use until the
Northern barbarian beat down her
frontiers; gold held no place in the
coinage till the imperialism of the
Caesars had taken its lead in her
decline.&#8221;</p>

<p>(1) Do you mean to say, that gold
and silver did not exist as currency,
prior to that period referred to in the
passage just quoted?</p>

<p>The Doctor says you are all wrong
here and asks that your authority for
the declaration be given.</p>

<p>(2) He wants you to give more
explicitly your authority for contending
that paper money is Constitutional;
he combats the idea of the
Constitutionality of a paper currency,
asserting that gold and silver is the
money of the Constitution and not
paper.</p>

<p>(3) What is your authority for
saying that Mr. Cleveland ruled that
Governmental notes which were payable
<i>in coin</i> should be redeemed in
<i>gold only</i>? He disputes this.</p>

<p>(4) In your glowing description of
the effects of paper currency, during
the wars referred to by you, how it
fed and clothed the soldier and kept
starvation from those the soldiers left
at home&mdash;he asserts that the gold and
silver currency in circulation during
the times you allude to could have
accomplished all you claim; independent
of a paper currency.</p>

<p>(5) Was the paper money issued
by the Confederate Government during
the Civil War as good at any time,
during said war, as the paper money
issued by the Federal Government
during the same war? If not, why
not?</p>

<p>Understand me, I am perfectly in
accord with you. I am asking these
questions in order that you may
have an opportunity to knock the
sophisticated props from under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span>
gold bug delusions and the people
given the plain facts.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr10">Respectfully,</span><br />
<span class="padr2"><span class="smcap">W. M. Hairston</span>.</span></p>

<hr class="short" />

<h4 class="answer">ANSWER.</h4>

<p>(1) Yes. Gold and silver were
used in commerce and commodities,
even as precious metals, <i>but not as
legal tender money</i>. The legal tender
money of Sparta was of iron. Lycurgus
made it so, for a special purpose.
See Plutarch&#8217;s &#8220;Lives,&#8221; or Aristotle
on &#8220;Government.&#8221;</p>

<p>The legal tender money of Rome
was copper during all the long and
bloody years of her relentless and
resistless march to world-power.</p>

<p>Gold and silver were used in commerce
<i>on the basis of barter</i>&mdash;but not
on any other.</p>

<p>Neither gold nor silver were coined
<i>into legal tender money</i>, until <i>after</i>
Rome had become Mistress of the
World.</p>

<p>See any standard History of Rome&mdash;Mommsen&#8217;s
for instance; and see,
also, Del Mar&#8217;s &#8220;Money and Civilization.&#8221;</p>

<p>(2) Paper money <i>is</i> Constitutional,
for the reason that the Constitution,
itself, gives to Congress the right to
coin legal tender money, and the Supreme
Court of the United States, in
a case brought to test that very question,
decided, in effect, that the word
coin, as used in the Constitution, has
the sense of &#8220;create,&#8221; and that Congress
can create legal tender money
out of paper, if it sees fit to do so.</p>

<p>Congress <i>had</i> seen fit to do so, for
the good and sufficient reason that
the expenses of the Government had
increased to more than a million dollars
per day, and there was no specie
money in the Treasury.</p>

<p>The Government made money out
of paper because it had nothing else
to make it out of.</p>

<p>Ground hog case, Doctor.</p>

<p>(3) The facts in the case. The
Contracts were payable in coin, just
as in France. The <i>option</i>, of payment
in silver or in gold, belonged to
the Government <i>under the words and
in the spirit of the contract</i>.</p>

<p>In France, it was the same. The
creditors claimed payment in gold,
both in this country and in France.</p>

<p>The French Government calmly
bossed the situation <i>as any real Government
should</i>, and paid the contracts
as <i>it</i> pleased <i>in either</i> &#8220;coin.&#8221;
When the French Government felt
like paying gold coin, gold was paid.
When the Government felt like paying
silver coin, silver was paid.</p>

<p>In either case, the creditor got what
his contract entitled him to get&mdash;<span class="smcapall">COIN</span>.</p>

<p>But Mr. Cleveland&#8217;s &#8220;Government&#8221;
was not so robust. He took it
into his head that &#8220;the bankers had
the country by the leg.&#8221; In fact, he
told Mr. Oates of Alabama that such
was the case.</p>

<p>Absurd!</p>

<p>No <i>real Government</i> would ever
get into that kind of blue funk.</p>

<p>Mr. Cleveland should have shown
some of the &#8220;back bone&#8221; that we
have heard so much about. He should
have said to those Wall Street Raiders,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you <span class="smcapall">COIN</span>&mdash;get anything else
if you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the Government had the gold,
the yellow metal should have been
handed out. When the Government
did not have the gold, it should have
handed out silver&mdash;saying to the
Raiders, &#8220;Take it, or leave it. Your
contract says <span class="smcapall">COIN</span>. There is coin. We
make you <i>the legal tender</i> of it. If
you don&#8217;t take it when so tendered,
<i>your claim against the Government is
as dead as Julius Caesar</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Then</span> the Government would have
had <i>the Bankers</i> &#8220;by the leg.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, you see, Cleveland was standing
in with the Wall Street crowd&mdash;and
that makes all the difference.</p>

<p>Suppose our friend, the Doctor
referred to by Mr. Hairston, owed ten
different notes of ten dollars each,
every one of them containing the plain
statement that they are payable in
&#8220;<i>coin</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter w420">
<img src="images/illo119.jpg" alt="Cartoon" width="420" height="595" />
<p class="largeillo"><a href="images/illo119lg.jpg">Large illustration</a></p>
<p class="caption">&#8220;THE CONUNDRUM IS: WHAT WOULD BE LEFT TO UNCLE SAM, IN THE MATTER OF
NATIONAL FINANCE, AFTER THE BANKERS SHALL HAVE GOT
ALL THAT THEY WANT?&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span></p>

<p>Suppose that they fall due and are
presented for payment. Suppose the
Doctor has half the money in gold
coin and the balance in silver coin.
Suppose he offers the entire $100 in
coin, in satisfaction of the debt.</p>

<p>Suppose the holder of the notes
rejects the silver &#8220;coin,&#8221; and demands
the entire debt in gold coin.</p>

<p>What would the Doctor do?</p>

<p>Would he hurry and scurry about,
hunting for gold to satisfy the exacting
creditor? I&#8217;ll bet a medium sized
mouse-colored mule that he wouldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>The Doctor <i>knows</i> that silver coin
is legal tender, and <i>was contemplated
as one of the coins of payment at the
time the contract was made</i>.</p>

<p>Consequently, he would tender the
silver, and if the <i>offer to pay</i> in that
&#8220;coin&#8221; were refused, the Doctor
would simply let the creditor do what
the heathen does when Christian Civilization
gets after him&mdash;<span class="smcapall">RAGE</span>.</p>

<p>(4) Let the Doctor peruse the Life
of Chase, who was Secretary of the
Treasury under Mr. Lincoln, and he
will realize how much he is in error.</p>

<p>Many other authorities might be
cited.</p>

<p>Gold and silver had disappeared.
Specie payments had ceased. The
Government was about &#8220;broke.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The daily expense account was
approaching the two million dollar
mark.</i></p>

<p>Spaulding, Salmon P. Chase, Thaddeus
Stevens and others realized that
unless the Government could float a
paper currency the jig was up.</p>

<p>It was just about then that <i>Lincoln
expressed the opinion that some of the
Wall Street bankers ought to be shot</i>.
They were manifesting every disposition
to take advantage of the distress
of the Government. They were showing
that they meant to get rich off the
war. And they accomplished their
purpose.</p>

<p>They failed to obstruct the plan to
issue paper money, but they succeeded
in having Congress virtually say that
while the Greenback was good enough
for the soldier who was shedding his
blood for his country, it was not good
enough for the Bondholder who was
sitting at ease in the financial Zion of
Wall Street.</p>

<p>(5) My understanding is that the
first paper money issued by the Confederate
Government circulated at par
<i>when first issued</i>.</p>

<p>The legal tender currency of any
Government must depend, in any case,
upon the strength, resources and
credit of the Government.</p>

<p>Even the coin-currency <i>sinks to the
mere commodity-value of the coin</i>,
when the Government sinks.</p>

<p>Even now there is an <i>artificial value
in gold coin, put there by law</i>.</p>

<p>No pile of a million dollars in gold
coin would sell for a million dollars
<i>as metal</i>.</p>

<p>In such a heap of gold you must
allow for &#8220;wear and tear.&#8221;</p>

<p>The law <i>does allow</i> for that very
thing. If the gold coin is worn away
to a greater extent than ten per cent,
the Government will not receive it as
legal tender&mdash;nor will the metropolitan
banks receive it.</p>

<p>But anything <i>less</i> than ten per cent
loss in weight, <i>the law makes good</i>, by
declaring that <i>such</i> coins are <i>legal
tender</i>.</p>

<p>Few people stop to think of that.</p>

<p>Therefore, every kind of money is
fiat money; that is, <span class="smcapall">THE LAW MAKES IT</span>.</p>

<p>Now, it must be self-evident that
<i>the value which law puts into currency</i>
<span class="smcapall">SINKS, WHEN THE LAW-MAKING
POWER SINKS</span>.</p>

<p>If one can conceive of such a thing
as the annihilation of the United
States we must know that our gold
coins would at once go into the scales
to be weighed and priced <i>as metal</i>;
our silver dollars would do precisely
the same thing, and each of them
would be worth less than 70 cents.</p>

<p>As for our paper money, it would
be waste paper, and nothing else.</p>

<p>United States greenbacks would<span class="pagenum" id="Page121">[121]</span>
amuse the collectors of fifty years
hence, just as Confederate bills do
those of the present day.</p>

<h3 class="question">Four Pertinent Questions
Answered.</h3>

<p class="right padr2">Enterprise, Ala.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Hon. Thomas Watson, Thomson, Ga.</i>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;1. What are the fundamental
principles of the four parties,
Populist, Socialist, Democratic
and Republican?</p>

<p>2. Do you favor the way the
United States allows the banks to use
national currency without interest
and then charge the people 12 per
cent? If not, why not?</p>

<p>3. Do you think there is any likelihood
of the Rural Free Delivery ever
being discontinued and if so on what
grounds?</p>

<p>4. What does the Parcels Post Bill
advocate?</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<h4 class="answer">ANSWER</h4>

<p>(1) The Populists believe in the
Public Ownership of Public Utilities&mdash;such
as Railroads, Telegraph and
Telephone Lines, and Express Companies.</p>

<p>They look upon the iron highway
as a Public Road that should belong
to the Public. They believe that the
tremendous power which private
ownership gives to the private corporations
now owning the railroads is too
great, <i>too ruinous when improperly
used</i>, to be exercised by those whose
sole aim is to extract the utmost possible
dollar of profit out of the franchise.</p>

<p>The Populists believe, also, that
there should be <i>a return to the money-system
of the Constitution</i>.</p>

<p>The National Banks have <span class="smcapall">USURPED</span>
the function of supplying the country
with a proper currency.</p>

<p>At the present time, when the Government
has but $353,000,000 of its
own paper notes circulating as money,
the National Banks have the enormous
sum of $583,000,000 of <i>their</i> paper
notes in circulation <i>as money</i>.</p>

<p>Populists contend that it is the prerogative
and <span class="smcapall">THE DUTY</span> of the government
to create <span class="smcapall">ALL THE MONEY
THAT CIRCULATES</span>, and to hold unto
itself the power of <i>regulating the supply</i>.</p>

<p>Populists believe in the Tax upon
Incomes, and contend that this tax
should progressively increase as the
Income increases. They believe also
in a tax upon Inheritance.</p>

<p>Populists lay particular stress upon
<span class="smcap">the great principle of Direct Legislation</span>.
They believe in allowing the
people to compel the law-making
power to act when they, the people,
want certain laws. They contend that
it is no more than right <i>to compel</i> the
law-makers <i>to refer proposed legislation
to those who are affected by it</i>.
This principle has worked happily
wherever given a fair trial, and is
usually called the <i>Initiative and
Referendum</i>.</p>

<p>Populists contend, also, that all
officers should be elected by direct
vote of the people, and that the people
should have the right at any time <i>to
retire an officer who has forfeited
their confidence</i>.</p>

<p>This principle is usually referred
to as the <i>Right of Recall</i>.</p>

<p>In practice it proves a most excellent
method of <span class="smcapall">MAKING THE OFFICE-HOLDER
&#8220;WALK THE CHALK.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Populists also believe that we should
have a system of Postal Savings
Banks. These would furnish to the
people <i>convenient</i> and <i>safe</i> places of
deposit for their savings; and the
system would go far to lessen the dangerous
power of the metropolitan
banks.</p>

<p>Populists are opposed to land monopoly,
favor the eight-hour day in
factories and similar industries, and
believe that the employment of children
of tender age in manufacturing
establishments, mines, sweatshops,
etc., should be watched with hawk-like<span class="pagenum" id="Page122">[122]</span>
vigilance <i>and regulated with a parental
care which puts the</i> <span class="smcapall">WELL-BEING
OF THE CHILD</span> <i>above every other consideration
in the case</i>.</p>

<p>Populists believe in <span class="smcapall">UNTAXED NECESSARIES
OF LIFE</span>, and contend that whatever
tariff duties are imposed should
be laid upon luxuries.</p>

<p>In brief, Populists strive for the
adoption of those principles which
would make this <span class="smcap">a real Republic</span>,
instead of an Aristocracy ruled by a
Class, or a Plutocracy in which Dollars
dominate.</p>

<p>And during the whole time that the
Politicians and Sages and Powers
have been laughing at us, <span class="smcap">we have
been quietly furnishing with our
garments the wardrobes of such
eminent Politicians, Sages and
Powers as Roosevelt, Bryan and
Hearst</span>.</p>

<p>Bryan accuses Roosevelt of stealing
the very clothes <i>that Bryan himself
stole from us</i>.</p>

<p>As for Hearst&mdash;before he fell down
on that Murphy deal&mdash;his editorials
and speeches were nothing in the
world but the echo of James B. Weaver,
Jerry Simpson and Mary Ellen
Lease!</p>

<p>Had he kept up the lick, and not
gone into that deal with Murphy, <span class="smcap">he
would have been elected Governor
of New York</span>. He parted with his
most valuable asset when he ceased to
be an Independent.</p>

<p>The Socialists <i>think</i> they believe in
the collective ownership of those
things necessary to the production and
distribution of wealth, <i>but what they
are actually driving at</i> <span class="smcapall">IS THE CONFISCATION
OF PRIVATE PROPERTY</span> and a
jolly good division of the same, in
order that <span class="smcap">the Have Nots will be
upon an equal footing with the
Haves</span>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the inner meaning of practical
Socialism, and that&#8217;s why it
assumes so savage a character in our
great cities.</p>

<p>In the hearts of the rank and file
Socialists, <i>are burning the same fierce
fires as animated</i> <span class="smcap">the Goths and the
Huns when they bore down upon
opulent Rome</span>.</p>

<p>I have heard these people talk and
I <i>know</i> what it is <i>they really mean</i>.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party, at present,
hasn&#8217;t got any principles capable of
proof.</p>

<p>They are waiting for the next National
Convention to hand out a new
suit of clothes.</p>

<p>They are awful sick and tired of
that Parker platform, which is <i>almost</i>
the same as the Republican platform&mdash;as
poor old Gassaway Davis said.</p>

<p>But they cannot &#8220;point with pride&#8221;
to any other platform until the National
Convention meets. Just what
will <i>then</i> be done, it would take an
able-bodied prophet to tell. My own
opinion is that they will adopt the
leading principles of Populism and
put Bryan to running for the Presidency
again.</p>

<p>The Republican Party is doing just
what Alexander Hamilton thought
ought to be done&mdash;running the Government
in partnership with the rich,
for the benefit of the rich.</p>

<p>The Republican rule is a Plutocracy,
tempered by an occasional spasm
of Rooseveltism.</p>

<p>(2) No. Because I do not believe
in Special Privilege, nor in the confiscation
of $134,000,000 of money
that belongs to the taxpayers. To
take away the people&#8217;s money on the
pretext that the Government needs it
to pay expenses, and then <i>to deliver
it over to a few Pet Banks to be used
without interest</i>, <span class="smcap">is Confiscation</span>.
And it&#8217;s a burning <span class="smcapall">NATIONAL INJUSTICE
AND SHAME</span>!</p>

<p>(3) No. Because Congress dare
not do it. The people would not stand
it.</p>

<p>(4) The transportation by the
Government, through the mails, of
small packages&mdash;say one, two, three,
four, five, ten, fifteen pounds&mdash;at a
moderate cost, thus protecting the
people from the robber Express Companies.</p>

<p>Two years old at the time that the
deliberate treachery of William H.
Seward provoked the rash Confederates
into firing upon Fort Sumter,&mdash;the
costly folly against which Bob
Toombs protested in vain,&mdash;Mr. Harben
heard and saw much of the actual
marching and countermarching of the
ensuing four years of <span class="smcap">the most
utterly insane war recorded in
History</span>.</p>

<p>Having been given a private education,
the young man embarked in
business enterprises, and it was not
until after 1886 that a mediocre
business man was offered up, a willing
sacrifice, to a first-class literary artist.
Harben, the business man, means
nothing to anybody, but Harben, the
literary genius, means a vast deal to
everybody&mdash;for he is, today, the most
distinctly <i>original and creative literary
genius in America</i>.</p>

<p><i>David Harum</i> took the world by
storm because of its unique portrayal
of a typical American business-man&mdash;shrewd,
strong, persistent, humorous,
rough in most places and soft in
spots. Banker and horse-trader,
David Harum knew human nature
like a book, and was chock full of
that rare article called common sense.</p>

<p>Abner Daniel was in all respects
the equal of David Harum, without
being an imitation; Pole Baker was
superior, in some respects, to Abner
Daniel, and Ann Boyd enters a different
class altogether.</p>

<p>The creations of Dickens and
Thackeray offer nothing better, nothing
more human, nothing more symmetrically
natural and fascinating,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span>than this heroic woman&mdash;tender-hearted,
pure, brave and true&mdash;whose
husband forsakes her, whose child is
taken away from her, whose enemies
persecute her, whose friends drop
away from her, but who, standing at
bay and battling with the whole array,
<span class="smcapall">CONQUERS</span>.</p>

<p>It is pathetic and it is grand.</p>

<h2>A Peep Into the Weekly Papers.</h2>

<h3>Disgraceful Railroad Service.</h3>

<p>Sometimes &#8220;patience ceases to be a
virtue&#8221; and this is one of the times.</p>

<p>The <i>Record</i> has kept quiet on the
subject of the disgraceful, indifferent,
unwarranted and careless manner in
which the Southern Railway has
treated its patrons from Toccoa to
Elberton, through fear of being
classed as a chronic kicker.</p>

<p>But the thing has become so awful
until this paper can keep still no longer.</p>

<p>Our business men here in Royston&mdash;and
we suppose it&#8217;s the same way
in Lavonia, Bowersville, Canon and
Bowman&mdash;are losing money every
day in the week through this giant
corporation&#8217;s ill-treatment. Our cotton
buyers have hundreds of bales of
cotton stored here in every conceivable
place because they can&#8217;t get cars to
ship it away.</p>

<p>Our merchants have goods on the
road which were shipped to them
days, weeks and almost months ago,
and are losing sales daily because they
can&#8217;t get the goods delivered on time.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is no freight train
to arrive here for two days at a time.
Whose fault this is <i>The Record</i> doesn&#8217;t
know, but it must be the &#8220;Big Guns&#8221;
who own the road.</p>

<p>Not a freight train has arrived here
on time in two months. Thousands
of dollars have been lost to the merchants
and farmers of this section
through the criminal neglect of those
who are at the head of this greedy
octopus, better known as the Southern
Railway, which has Georgia in its
power as strongly as ever a boa constrictor
of South Africa encircled its
victim.
</p>

<p>How long? Oh Lord! How long,
will this thing last?</p>

<p>Hasn&#8217;t Georgia&#8217;s Railroad Commission
some power to do something
for the people of Georgia in this matter?
If they haven&#8217;t they might as
well close up shop and go home and
try and find some calling more suitable
to their respective talents, provided
the members of that representative
(?) body have any.</p>

<p>The depot agent at this place is as
painstaking and gentlemanly as any
railroad official in Georgia, but is
helpless. He is worked to death for
want of sufficient help. He is doing
the work of two men.</p>

<p>From the section boss to the highest
official on the line in question&mdash;the
Elberton Air Line&mdash;that&#8217;s the road
we&#8217;re talking about&mdash;the pay is less
by one third than it should be and not
half enough help is employed in any
of the departments.</p>

<p>If the crew on the freight train that
runs on this road were animals, we
could indict the authorities for cruelty
to animals, but as they are only human
beings there is no law to cover the
case. More&#8217;s the pity. There&#8217;s something
wrong with the law when it
allows a greedy corporation to work
its men to death.</p>

<p>Why not put on two freight trains
per day, having them to leave Elberton
and Toccoa early in the morning
and returning in the afternoon? <i>The
Record</i> believes this would solve the
problem and stop the congestion of
freight on this line, at least.</p>

<p>The people of this section are broad
minded and generous, and only want
what is due them from any standpoint,
but propose to get what is coming
to them if it is gettable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span></p>

<p>As we said in the beginning, we
tried to keep still about this matter,
but our hammer has begun to knock
and we propose to keep it up until
something is done.</p>

<p><i>The Record</i> will begin, next week,
to circulate a petition among our business
men regarding this matter and
proposes to send said petition to Vice-President
Andrews, of the Southern,
in Charlotte, N. C., to Mr. McMannus,
in Greenville, S. C., and to the great
and only Georgia Railroad Commission,
in the city of Atlanta.</p>

<p>Will our sister cities along the
Southern, from Toccoa to Elberton, do
the same thing?</p>

<p><i>The Record</i> will wait and see.&mdash;<i>Royston
(Ga.) Record.</i></p>

<h3>Paid Dear for Their Titles.</h3>

<p>The girls of these United States
have always borne the name of being
the most vivacious, intelligent and
common sense mortals of any other
nation, but as is the case in all other
things, there are exceptions to the
rule, and when they do depart from
the record they can make the very
worse breaks of any. Just think of
as intelligent, cultivated girls as Anna
Gould and Consuelo Vanderbilt allowing
such broken down old foreign
sports, gamblers and roues as Count
Boni de Castellane and the Duke of
Marlborough, persuading them that
they were loved, not for their riches
but themselves, and marrying such
cattle when they could have secured
good, honest, sober, loving husbands
at home. One is now suing for divorce
in Paris after her Frenchman
has spent eight millions of her money,
and the other is applying for a separation
in London. If it was foreign
titles these girls were seeking, they
have paid dear for their little toy
and really deserve no sympathy, but
if they sought the men merely for
their supposed merits, the two women
ought to have guardians appointed
over them for the remainder of their
lives, for they have no idea of how to
take care of themselves.&mdash;<i>Gainesville
(Fla.) Elevator.</i></p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>Honesty and Honor.</h3>

<p>Pope says that an honest man is the
noblest work of God and Paul says
to provide things honest in the sight
of all men.</p>

<p>Webster says that honor is esteem
due or paid to worth. Bacon says
that some in their actions do woo,
and affect honor and reputation.</p>

<p>In common parlance we call a man
honest, if he pays his just and true
debts. Is that true? If a person pays
debts with money secured by extorting
the widows and orphans, by pressing
the poor, by selling hell and damnation
to youths, is he to be called
honest? Certainly not. He is neither
honest nor honorable.</p>

<p>There is another class of folk, who
think themselves honest and would
resent with their strong arms even an
insinuation of dishonesty on their
part, that fall as far short of being
honest and honorable men as thieves
do of being angels. They are an ingenious
sort of people, whose heads are
full of tricks and schemes, and their
greatest joy consists of working them
upon the public. They had rather
make money dishonestly than honestly.
To enlist them in any cause only
the whisper of the word scheme is
necessary. Yet, they pay their debts
and they seem to think that this alone
will carry them to &#8220;heaven on flowery
beds of ease.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The honest and honorable men in a
community are those, with characters
so well known, as to never be
approached secretly or otherwise, in
behalf of screening any evil, upholding
any wrong, fostering any unholy
scheme. They stand boldly for right
living and everybody knows it.</i></p>

<p>The clever, popular men of a community
are not always the honorable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page127">[127]</span>
and the honest. Their popularity often
results from their closed lips and
silent hands. They are polite, generous
and liberal, but are approachable
and ready participants in any sort of
secret deal for a little cash. Money
in their eyes looks brighter than honesty
and they are neither honest nor
honorable, although very clever fellows.</p>

<p>But there is in every community
persons, possessed of righteous consciences,
with so high ideals of the
right and so much hatred for the
wrong, as to be unable to restrain
themselves in taking brave, bold
stands in every civic and religious
reform.</p>

<p><i>Boys, the object of this article is to
elevate manhood in Gwinnett county
and the latter are the characters for
your patterns. Be men.</i></p>

<p>Say, what is honor? &#8217;Tis the finest
sense</p>

<p>Of justice which the human mind
can frame,</p>

<p>Intent each lurking frailty to disclaim,</p>

<p>And guard the way of life from all
offense,</p>

<p>Suffered or done.&mdash;Wordsworth.

<h3>Sacred Prosperity.</h3>

<p>Divine right is still to be discovered
in high finance, although not so usual
as a few years ago it was. A group
of minority stockholders, clamoring
for an accounting from Mr. HARRIMAN,
were consoled by his
lawyer with the assurance that
&#8220;Mr. Harriman moves in a higher
world, where stockholders may not
hope to enter.&#8221; The president of the
Union Pacific Railroad may continue
to keep stockholders beyond the battlements
of his personal paradise; but
the Interstate Commerce Commission,
by virtue of the Railroad Rate bill,
have the right to make inquisitorial
entry. The rate bill became a law on
August 28. The raising of the Union
Pacific dividend from six to ten per
cent. was effected by Mr. Harriman
on August 16. If the Interstate Commerce
Commission have been under
embarrassment about picking a
railroad which shall be compelled to
lower its freight rates, the juxtaposition
of dates should make them easy.
A road which at once pays exorbitant
dividends and charges exorbitant
rates seems to need their services.
It is not for the purpose of paying
higher wages to his conductors and
engineers that Mr. Harriman charges
high rates. His operating expenses
are but 52.51 per cent. of his gross
receipts; whereas the average of all
our railroads is 67.79 per cent.
When a shipper pays Mr. Harriman
one dollar, fifty-three cents goes to
pay the trainmen and for the other
purposes embraced under operating
expenses; about two cents goes for
taxes, and forty-five cents goes to paying
the interest on bonds and to meeting
the necessities of Mr. Harriman&#8217;s
ten per cent. requirements.&mdash;<i>Collier&#8217;s
Weekly.</i></p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>Trial for Murder.</h3>

<p>Our system of criminal jurisprudence
is better than most, and as good
as any with the possible exception of
the English. But no one denies that
it has monstrous faults. In New York
recently one man shot another over
a woman. Both men were rich and the
woman beautiful&mdash;a combination that
will instantly wreck the essential
purpose of criminal law anywhere in
the United States. Already the newspapers
abundantly foreshadow what
will happen. The material facts in
the case&mdash;so far as concerns the purpose
of the law to protect human life&mdash;were
brought out by the coroner in
about half an hour. Hereafter we
shall hear very little of them.</p>

<p>Press reports assure us that a fine
array of legal talent on either side
<span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span>
is preparing to play a splendid game
of chess. If it can be shown that one
of the men led a life more vicious
than the other that will score ten for
the side that shows it. The sorry
muck-heap of the woman&#8217;s career
will be raked fore and aft until it has
yielded every point that will count on
one side or the other. The lawyers
will construct a great melodrama,
with the villain, heroine and hero, to
be presented to the jury. The verdict&mdash;the
very life of the accused&mdash;will
depend upon the skill with
which the game is played and the
success with which the melodrama is
&#8220;put on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou shalt not kill,&#8221; says the
commandment. One can imagine a
completely civilized state, in noble
dignity, requiring the one man to
answer whether he did kill and murder
the other, contrary to its statute. It
is merely an imagining, however.
Our famous murder trials, with their
tawdry tricks in the face of death
and their rotten plays to sentiment,
are pretty exclusively barbarous.&mdash;<i>Saturday
Evening Post.</i></p>

<h3>The Negroes.</h3>

<p>Senator Bailey talks, as there is no
law against his utterances. &#8220;The free
negro,&#8221; he declares, in his amiable
attempt to induce in his hearers a calm
and rational mode of thought, &#8220;is a
more serious menace to the South than
the negro in slavery.&#8221; In Alabama, a
couple of weeks ago, at a Republican
convention, there was not a negro
present&mdash;one of the details indicating
a general drift of the Republicans
toward leaving the negroes out of
their politics. Meantime, the negroes
themselves are divided sharply in their
meeting of the situation. The so-called
&#8220;Niagara Movement&#8221; puts out
an address to the country which
observes: &#8220;We claim for ourselves
every single right that belongs to a
free-born American, political, civil,
and social.&#8221; The whole address is a
mass of almost bombastic rhetoric on
this theme. Meantime, another leader
speaks: &#8220;Let constructive progress
be the dominant note among us
in every section of America. An inch
of progress is worth more than a yard
of fault-finding. The races that have
grown strong and useful have not done
so by depending upon finding fault
with others, but by presenting to the
world evidences of progress in agriculture,
industrial and business life,
as well as through religious, educational,
and civic growth.&#8221; Without
failing to make it clear that he wishes
the equal protection of the law, Mr.
Washington refuses to complain, to
whine about social rights and aspirations,
and prefers to tell his fellows
the most useful things to do. He
leaves white faults to white men and
warns negroes against negro weaknesses.
Which leader will the negroes
follow, and which speaks with wisdom
and with strength?&mdash;<i>Collier&#8217;s Weekly.</i></p>

<h3>The Labor Famine.</h3>

<p>What has become of all our laborers
is a question which no one seems able
to answer just at present, but that
they are not to be had is too well
known. In the cotton belt of Texas,
churches and Sunday schools are
organizing parties and going into the
fields to save the crop; in other of the
cotton growing states the women are
helping the men gather the staple;
immigrants are offered work almost
before they have put a foot on American
soil; out West two great rival
railroads are scouring the woods for
men; factories where child labor has
been legislated out are running short-handed,
and it would appear that if
our prosperity did not abate a bit
from other causes it would do so from
lack of labor with which to carry it on.
Meanwhile communities are learning
the gentle art of smiling, trade is
booming and not even an approaching
election can offer an opening to the
pessimist.&mdash;<i>Pensacola News.</i></p>

<hr class="sec" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page129">[129]</span></p>

<h3>Cotton and the Negro.</h3>

<p>Our Statesmen tell us in one breath
that the salvation of the South is in
the planting of less cotton and getting
more for it and, in the very next
breath, they say that immigration will
save us. They invite the yankee to
come, and the German, and the Irish,
and the Scandinavian and even the
Italian.</p>

<p>If it be true that we are planting
enough cotton, even too much, and it
is true, wherein will the South be
benefited by having thousands of the
foreigners settle here to raise more
cotton? There is but one answer. We
don&#8217;t need any more cotton planters.</p>

<p>But it is contended that foreign
immigration will settle the race question.
Maybe it will. Maybe it won&#8217;t.
The cotton patch negro hasn&#8217;t given
us any trouble, nor will he, and he
isn&#8217;t going to leave either. He is satisfied,
his landlord is satisfied, and a
German or a Scandinavian upon the
scene will mean two cotton patches
instead of one, one for him and one for
the negro.</p>

<p>True, there are many of our ambitious
farmers who can&#8217;t secure
enough laborers to make enough cotton
to get rich as fast as they would, but
they&#8217;ll get rich quick enough in using
our present available labor, thereby
raising less cotton, getting more for
it, and, at the same time, either resting
their lands or sowing it in small
grain. And when these wealthy
farmers plant less cotton, they benefit
every poor fellow, standing between
the plow handles, in the entire South.</p>

<p>And this one or two horse farmer
is the ideal citizen, anyway. The best
communities are those made up of
small farmers. The churches, schools
and social conditions in a community,
in which one man owns all the land
and runs forty plows, are not as good
as one with forty land owners. Oglethorpe
county would, no doubt, be a
better county today, if Jim Smith had
never been born, and this is not said
with the spirit of criticising a single
act of his life, either.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s all right for immigrants to
build our cities, our railroads, our
manufacturing enterprises or to labor
in the cities, on the railroads, in the
factories or even take servants&#8217; places,
but the South doesn&#8217;t need any more
cotton raisers.&mdash;<i>Gwinnett (Ga.) Journal.</i></p>

<h3>The Railroad Power.</h3>

<p>The railroad magnates have divided
up the lines in this country among
nine families of plutocrats, who by
controlling transportation of passengers
and freight, can control the Government.
They are divided as follows:</p>

<table class="railroads" summary="Railroads">

<tr>
<td class="family">Harriman</td>
<td class="mileage">22,276</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="family">Vanderbilt</td>
<td class="mileage">20,493</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="family">Pennsylvania</td>
<td class="mileage">20,138</td>
</tr>

<td class="family">Hill</td>
<td class="mileage">19,407</td>

<td class="family"><span class="padl4">Total</span></td>
<td class="mileage"><span class="bt">146,112</span></td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>That is three-fourths of the mileage
of the country and the control of the
main lines in every state and territory.
It puts into the hands of these
men a greater power than was ever
exercised by any group of kings, lords
and dukes who ever formed a community
of interests. In all past history,
to overthrow such a power as
that, a resort to long and bloody wars
was the only recourse. It remains to
be seen whether the great peace movements
of the last few years, for which
Andrew Carnegie has built a temple
at The Hague, will produce a sentiment
strong enough to settle this
question peaceably. Would Andrew
Carnegie encourage anarchistic disorders
if he thought there was a danger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span>of a reduction of the tariff on
steel? Railroad combination and
robber tariffs are only another manifestation
of what we once called the
&#8220;money power.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Omaha (Neb.,)

<h3>Populism Forever.</h3>

<p>Whatever may be the future of the
People&#8217;s party, whether it is doomed
to pass away and give place to some
other party that will present its principles,
or whether it may yet rise as it
deserves to do and get control of the
Government, remains yet to be seen.</p>

<p>One thing is certain. It has already
accomplished more in this Government
in the last fifteen years in the
way of creating public sentiment and
political conviction than both of the
old parties.</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago the two old parties
were discussing nothing but
Tariff. The Money question, the Railroad
question and the Trust question
were entirely ignored by them. Not
because the leaders of the two old
parties did not know the magnitude
and importance of these questions;
but they got their campaign boodle
from these rich corporations and they
were willing to accept the money and
let the common people perish.</p>

<p>When the Populists came on the
scene they began to &#8220;cry aloud and
spare not.&#8221;</p>

<p>They showed that the same laws of
supply and demand that regulated the
prices of other commodities, also regulated
the price of money, that when
money was plentiful, prices were high,
all kinds of business prosperous and
labor fully employed and well paid.
While on the other hand when money
was scarce it was high; all industries
paralized, men out of work and their
families suffering for bread.</p>

<p>They showed that the great railroad
corporations had secured the
public franchises and were taxing the
people without their consent and without
mercy.</p>

<p>They showed that their great corporations,
growing enormously rich
were combining together and forming
&#8220;Trusts&#8221; and that they will eventually
control all prices, and as completely
own and control the country
as did the Barons under the Feudal
system.</p>

<p>Their cry and their plea was invincible.</p>

<p>Their arguments could not be answered.</p>

<p>Ridicule and abuse might serve to
keep them down for awhile, but the
just indictment against the two old
parties was destined some day to be
sustained.</p>

<p>Today the Populist looks on with
pleasure and sees his principles growing
in public favor every day.</p>

<p>The Republican president and the
Democratic leader are endorsing the
very doctrines that were fifteen years
ago considered the most radical.</p>

<p>All honor to the Populists.&mdash;<i>Nevada
County (Ark.) Picayune.</i></p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>Sense.</h3>

<p>Can there be such a thing as a
radical conservative? John Temple
Graves thinks Col. Pleasant Stovall,
of the <i>Savannah Press</i>, fits that kind
of a job. We believe that a trimmer&mdash;if
that is what Col. Graves means
to call Col. Stovall&mdash;is the most decent
citizen that afflicts human society. He
stops rushing things when a sense of
the proprieties tells him that a thing
has been rushed far enough to make it
coarse or common (use which word
you prefer), and the result is that his
hair does not grow too long, nor his
ears too puritanically short.</p>

<p>Yes, sir, the medium grade takes
the cake. Except in an occasional

<h3>A Lesson in Fusion.</h3>

<p>Hearst got beat for Governor of
New York while the balance of the
State ticket he was on got elected. A
few of the successful candidates are
Independence League men, but most
of them are straight Democrats. Thus
Hearst&#8217;s reform work was turned to
the benefit of corrupt and foul Tammany.
We hope this lesson in fusion
will be enough for the League. Hearst
was defeated by about 60,000, while
the other State candidates on the
League-Democratic fusion ticket were
elected by small pluralities. Tammany
scratched Hearst. The Wall
Street element of the Democratic
party either scratched him or voted
the Republican ticket. We are inclined
to think well of Hearst because
of those who scratched him. Hearst
says the fight for the rights of the
people is still on. With his great
daily papers he can do a vast work
toward overthrowing the rule of the
money power, if he gets into the middle
of the road and stays there. But
if he endeavors to work within the old
party he will do more to prevent the
success of the people than forty Clevelands
could do. Maybe the thing
wasn&#8217;t hardly ripe and he had to back
out, which he did by fusing with the
Democrats after the League had nominated
a straight ticket. We are guessing
that Hearst will be in the middle
of the road supporting Tom Watson
for President in 1908.&mdash;<i>Missouri

<h3>A Significant Vote.</h3>

<p>Whatever may be said of W. R.
Hearst&#8217;s individual sincerity and integrity
of purpose, the vote which
almost landed him in the governor&#8217;s
chair of New York State&mdash;a position
which is next to the presidency&mdash;is
the vote which is dissatisfied with corporation
conditions. It is a significant
vote. And the strong anti-Hearst
sentiment among the &#8220;upper ten&#8221; all
over the South is also significant.
Everywhere men are, consciously or
unconsciously, taking their positions
along lines of economics.&mdash;<i>Farmers&#8217;

<h3>Where He Belongs.</h3>

<p>Tom Watson is back in Georgia,
where he belongs. He is too warm,
too impulsive, too frank and too honest
for New York&mdash;cold, calculating, deceitful,
hateful New York.&mdash;<i>Farmers&#8217;

<h2>Letters From the People.</h2>

<h3 class="letters" id="Ref01">Half Jackal and Half Hyena.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><i>Lucian L. Knight, Los Angeles, Cal.</i></p>

<p>I cannot silence without gratifying
the impulse which prompts me to
write you at once after reading what
you have to say about that superlative
scoundrel, Mann. As a friend who
holds you in loyal and affectionate
admiration, I resent with all my
heart the treatment which you have
received at the hands of one who is
man in name only and who in nature
is half jackal and half hyena. I am
aware how true it is that the most
insignificant of insects may vex even
the noble lion. Mann may be a millionaire,
but I warrant his shillings
are dirty. How miserably poor the
wretch is when the only assets he has
in the world are the millions which
lie in the bank!</p>

<p>I know how little things have
annoyed me at times and I know how
much I have appreciated an impulsive
word of sympathy, even from
&#8220;the least of these.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am sorry I could not get the
extracts you were to send me in time
for Vol. I of the Reminiscences which
will be ready for publication within
the next few weeks; but I hope to
get them in time for Vol. II. The
work will require two volumes. I
have met with so much encouragement
that I am warranted in beginning at
once upon Vol. II. Disappointed
in other cherished plans and prospects,
I am now putting my life&#8217;s
ambition into this work which I trust
to be able to make of literary and
historic value to Georgia.

<h3 class="letters">An Anonymous Slander Rebuked.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><i>W. H. Eddy, Los Angeles, Cal.</i></p>

<p>Can you explain what quality there
is in human nature, that prompts some
specimens of the race to the doing of
things which are admirably adapted
to the hindrance of all that they profess
to be in earnest support of?
Now, for instance: in <i>The Appeal to
Reason</i> of October 27th, is an
unsigned article headed, &#8220;Populism
and the Pap.&#8221; Being unsigned would
indicate that it came from the pen of
J. A. Wayland, or that of F. D. Warren,
the present Managing Editor.
Now, both of these men have been
earnest workers for several years, or
at least for what they conceive to be
the cause of socialism. It would seem
as though, when two men are associated
in a work which each of them
has advocated and written signed
articles in favor of, lauding it as a
movement opposed to dishonesty, deceit
and all the baser tendencies of the
depraved mind, that when he takes a
notion to stultify himself, descend to
the lowest practices of the gutter
blackguard, he would have consideration
enough for his associate to sign
his name, so that decent people who
may be so unfortunate as to peruse
it, and such of the patrons of the
paper as have both decency and
brains enough to resent it, might not
blame the innocent party inadvertently.</p>

<p>If socialism is anything, or is to be
anything in human history which is
to make for the betterment of
humanity, then it must rest upon the
fundamental principles of honesty,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page133">[133]</span>justice and truth. All those who
would not be cursed by its adoption
to-morrow, by reason of their lack of
development and their consequent
lack of capacity to appreciate its
meaning and the obligations inherent
in it, assert that brotherly love, the
golden rule, and the Sermon on the
Mount, are also corner-stones in the
foundation of its most noble structure.</p>

<p>But let us leave the latter out of
consideration for the present. It is
not conceivable that there can be dug
up in the office of the <i>Appeal</i> one
individual so low in the scale of
human development as not to concede
honor, truth and justice as being the
beginning, the very A B C of socialism.
What must we think, then, of
the estimate that the one who penned
the abominable article referred to,
places upon the intelligence of his
readers, to say nothing of the hundreds
who have drawn from the little
stock of their earnings which are
really needed for the comfort of themselves
and family, to assist this poor
degenerate in distributing his venom
and flaunting his idiocy in the faces
of a nation of intelligent people, to
the disheartenment of thousands of
advocates of socialism, and the great
glee of those who aver that the animus
of socialism and of all socialists
is such as &#8220;Breathes the hot breath of
brutal hate, and riots as it runs&#8221;
through the two columns of the &#8220;Appeal?&#8221;
To those who have not been
unfortunate enough to read it, suffice
it to say that it is a wholly uncalled
for, unsocialistic, and, from every
point of view, rascally, assault upon
Hon. Thomas E. Watson, and to make
it, if possible, more pusillanimous, it
is given publicity just at a time when,
on account of Mr. Watson&#8217;s having
been grievously misused by his former
business associates in the <i>Watson&#8217;s
Magazine</i> enterprise, Mr. Watson is
deserving of the sympathy of every
person who possesses a spark of decency.
It is cowardly in the extreme
to strike a person when he is down or
crippled.</p>

<p>Mr. Watson&#8217;s life history is now an
open book to anyone, not an absolute
ignoramus, in this broad country. He
has his prejudices. He has his own
political ideas, which, at the test of
the ballot box, have been shown to be
largely in the minority, but, to his
honor be it said, the fact that they
were not the winning card, has never
caused him for one moment to falter
in devoting time, money and energy
in their advocacy, a fact which of
itself would give the lie to the baseless,
senseless and hypocritical charge
of treachery and double dealing,
which, by their own statements, finds
250,000 duplications in this issue of
the Appeal.</p>

<p>It is doing too much honor to quote
from it, but the readers of progress
will excuse the presentation of some
short samples. &#8220;Tom appears to
have a grudge against whatever tends
toward progress.&#8221; Think of that in
reference to the father of the rural
free delivery postal system which
carries tens of thousands of copies of
this very diatribe of lies to the farmers
of the country, in whose interest
Watson succeeded in having this
system established, as the <i>Congressional
Record</i> will bear witness.
Again, &#8220;But he has been repudiated
by the respectable democratic press
of his state&mdash;as witness the merciless
exposure of his methods by the <i>Atlanta
Constitution</i> and the <i>Macon
Telegraph</i>!&#8221; Respectable! The <i>Atlanta
Constitution</i> and the <i>Macon
Telegraph</i>! Socialists of intelligence,
what have you to say of the
creature so lost to decency as to, in
the columns of the leading socialist
weekly paper of America, if not of the
world, so far as circulation goes, laud
the <i>Atlanta Constitution</i> and the
<i>Macon Telegraph</i>, notoriously the
most mercenary and most thoroughly
corporation-serving papers of the
entire South, and for no other reason&mdash;for
he can plead no other&mdash;than because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page134">[134]</span>they are fighting Tom Watson,
who happens to be under the ban of
his displeasure?</p>

<p>And why are the ultra corporation
journals fighting Tom Watson? Because
honest Tom Watson is sacrificing
his private interests in a determined
effort to defeat the
machinations of the Walter Parkers,
the Herrins and the Abe Ruefs of his
beloved state.</p>

<p>Again: &#8220;That Watson received
the price for his perfidy is not for a
moment to be doubted.&#8221; Whoever
penned those lines either knew that
he was penning a most villainous lie
or he is too ignorant to be worthy of
the contempt of a chimpanzee. There
isn&#8217;t a person with intelligence
enough to write connectedly on truth,
or any part of the scurrilous rot this
creature did, but knows perfectly
well that if Tom Watson had been
corruptible, he could have received
ten times more to have sold himself to
the very forces this creature is supposed
to be fighting, than it has ever
been claimed he did get. That is just
as true of Tom Watson as it is of
&#8217;Gene V. Debs. Everyone, including
the writer of that malicious screed,
<i>knows</i> that they both could be rolling
luxuriously in wealth if they had but
followed the course of these very papers
which he is pleased to declare
&#8220;respectable.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the last quotation is manly as
compared with this one: &#8220;It is said
that he has been up for sale before,
and was knocked down to the highest
bidder,&#8221; etc., &#8220;It is said!&#8221; The
language of the conscienceless gossip,
the method of the footpad, with the
sand-bag, or the gas-pipe who strikes
you out of the dark. Again: &#8220;John
M. Barnes, a man for whose veracity
many stand ready to vouch, etc.&#8221;
Very good, Mr. No-name. Mr.
Barnes is good enough authority to
use in an effort to injure your brother
man, Mr. Thos. Watson. Would you
accept Mr. John M. Barnes&#8217; statement
as to the offices you, your associates
and the <i>Appeal to Reason</i> are performing
in America, and would you
abide by and endorse them in your
own case? Never! And that very
fact impeaches your honesty in quoting,
as against Tom Watson, the
slanders of corporation hirelings
and political hacks, whom you know
are fighting him for what there is in
it. No! no! When you go straining
a point, you always <i>prove too
much</i>.</p>

<p>Be something like a man, and bid
him God speed in his task of awakening
the people to their dangers, even
if he does leave them short of being
full-fledged socialists.</p>

<p>Tom Watson&#8217;s opinions are not in
all respects mine. In fact, there are
many points on which we do not
agree. But if I have outgrown the
tenets of Populism, and he has not, or
if he sees so many falling away from
the mere party organization of populism
as to be heart-sore and discouraged,
and chooses to advocate <i>the same
principles</i> under the name of Jeffersonian
Democracy, he is still entitled
to the respect of friend and foe alike,
until he sacrifices principle to greed
or puerile hatred.</p>

<h3 class="letters">Wants to Follow Watson&#8217;s Pen.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><i>L. A. Benson, Clay Center, Kan.</i></p>

<p>I write to inquire as to the truth
or falsity of the rumor that you have
severed your connection with the
Magazine which bears your name. I
have been a voting Prohibitionist
since 1885. I bought the first issue
of &#8220;<i>Tom Watson&#8217;s</i>&#8221; and read it, and
have hungered for its appearance
ever since. I have read every line of
Editorial and other matter which
came from your pen. I was beginning
to think myself so much of a
Populist that I could &#8220;keep step.&#8221;
From 1894 until 1901 I lived in
Philadelphia, Pa., and judging the
Populists from the caricatures appearing
in Eastern papers I felt surprised
<span class="pagenum" id="Page135">[135]</span>to find that I have all along possessed
just such views as constitute the
essence of Populism. I find myself
unwilling to give up the opportunity
to follow your pen. I will regard it as
a matter of genuine kindness to me if
you will put me in connection with
the Magazine which takes your copy
and spreads it among your many disciples
and admirers. I regard the
work which you are doing as <i>fundamental</i>,
and I am aware that you, like
all leaders in reforms which touch the
money-king, will suffer. If it be in
the power of &#8220;Old Plute&#8221; to crucify
you, he will not be too tender. He will
not be lacking in heartless cruelty.
But while you are bidding high for the
hate and vengeance of &#8220;Old Plute&#8221;
you are winning the glorious title of
&#8220;friend&#8221; and &#8220;brother&#8221; to those
who are crushed &#8217;neath the heel of
this heartless, greedy foe. To <i>oppose</i>
him and to <i>stand the loving helper</i> of
men, is to trace the footsteps of the
Man of Galilee, up a modern Calvary.
In plain language, it is the essence
of pure and undefiled religion.

<p>In reply to your question in <i>Watson&#8217;s
Magazine</i> of August: &#8220;Is it
true that railroad corporations insure
the lives of the railroad mail clerks?&#8221;
I cannot speak for the railroad corporations,
but it was developed in
court here that the St. Lawrence
Broom &amp; Manufacturing Co., the
largest corporation in this section,
has the lives of its employes insured
for its benefit. This company employs
a large number of men and boys and
has never made any provisions for
their protection against the inclemency
of the weather, or the many dangers
of machinery that might be
averted.</p>

<p>I was an employe of this company
for fifteen years and have seen a
number of men and boys mangled and
maimed for life, but it was not known
until quite recently that the corporation
received insurance for every
employe that got crippled. A boy
got his hand cut off and sued the
company for damages and it was
clearly proven that the employes
were insured for the benefit of the

on account of your Editorials, which I

nothing will ever be accomplished in
the way of bringing this Government
again into the possession of the people

The reformers must get together
if this Republic is to be preserved,
if it is not even now too late
to save it. Of this I am certain: we
have no time left us for internal dissensions,
and I hope that so splendid

I have read your Magazine from the

a cotton gin which works on a new

in natural lengths, thereby enhancing
the price to the planter by one to five
cents per pound. The gin can be run
by hand, or by power, and a few
farmers can own one in common and
thereby earn money by ginning their
own cotton. The gin consists of
&#8220;mechanism for gradually opening
and loosening the cotton fibres while
still attached to the seeds, with means
for thereafter removing the seeds.&#8221;
Just take a little cotton and gradually
pull the fibres apart, without, however,
separating them from the seed,
until you have a large puff ball
and then see how easily they come
off at the seed. Well, that is what
this machine does. No &#8220;gin cut&#8221;
cotton in it. Seed practically unhurt,
also. Am looking for money
wherewith to build a large machine,
(the inventor made the working model
by hand himself); it does the work
fairly well, but it is getting to be
ram-shackle for demonstration purposes,
and then for capital wherewith
to work the gin commercially. Such

<p class="noindent">Mr. C. Q. DeFrance, New York City.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:&mdash;Please strike my name
from the list of subscribers to the
<i>Watson Magazine</i>. I learn the stockholders
endeavored to place restrictions
on Mr. Watson as Editor and
Manager, and he, for that reason,
severed his connection with it. Thank
God for that. I am glad to know
he had so much manhood about him.
Tom Watson is one among the greatest
statesmen the United States has.
It is a source of satisfaction to know
that he will neither speak nor write
with a corporation muzzle on. When
<span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[138]</span>the stockholders attempted to restrict
Mr. Watson in his Editorials for the
Magazine, they didn&#8217;t only insult him,
but they insulted every reader of it
who believes in the pure Jeffersonian
principles which Mr. Watson so ably
advocates and defends. I would be
proud of Tom Watson were he from
any other section of the Union. He
being a Southern man and a Georgian
at that, I am exceedingly proud of
him. I fear somebody has been taken
upon the Mount and shown the glorious
things the railroads will do if
they will only fall down and worship
them. If <i>no Watson</i> is with the Magazine
then <i>no Magazine for me</i>.</p>

<h3 class="letters">&#8220;It Would Be a Noble Charity.&#8221;</h3>

<p class="noindent"><i>Chas. D. Hunt, Gueydan, La.</i></p>

<p>Reading with interest your valuable
editorials in the October number
and the most striking and interesting
subject, &#8220;It Would be a Noble
Charity&#8221;&mdash;here you have treated a
subject in a light that any person
could not help from shielding with
an honest heart, with a strong desire
in mind to spread the cause of
charity, but you have almost been selfish
with your subject. What of the
territory bordering along the Gulf of
Mexico? That is, the extreme portion.</p>

<p>Here we have settlers of almost
ancient times. They are not altogether
uncivilized, but are not able to
meet the demands of our educated
requirements. Hence are we to still
keep them back or are we to give them
a helping hand? These people know
nothing of education and its help in
life, but toil with an earnest heart to
maintain <i>merely</i> a <i>scant living</i> and to
bring the younger class up in their
own path.</p>

<p>I think if the Humane Society
would stop and think deeply in regard
to the young boys and girls that
spend their school days in hard labor
out of school there would be something
done to protect them and give
them a chance for a better future
than is now before them.</p>

<p>It would be surprising to anyone
who has had the advantages of education
and <i>really</i> felt its <i>real value</i> in
life to stroll along the prairies and
see just how many bright young boys
and girls are out of touch with the
educated world. Why? Their parents
are not able to aid them to secure
an education, but are more than willing.</p>

<p>Do you not think much could be
done in both mountain and prairie
territories?</p>

<p>Having read in the <i>Missouri
World</i> that you had ceased writing
for <i>Watson&#8217;s Magazine</i>, I was
greatly surprised. I had supposed
that you owned the Magazine, and
had taken great pleasure in securing
subscriptions for it in this vicinity.
Some of those subscriptions have just
expired, and the subscribers say they
don&#8217;t want it again if you are not
going to write for it. That would
seem to sound the death knell of the
now so-called <i>Watson&#8217;s Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>When you start your new magazine
send me a sample copy, and I will
endeavor to give your subscription
list a little boost. I would also like
a few sample copies of your weekly
paper.</p>

<p>Looking forward and hoping to get
the November number of your Magazine,
I hear, verbally, that you have
severed your connection with that
periodical, and I don&#8217;t care now
whether it ever appears again, for
what I read in it was what you wrote,
little else. I know you quit your
association there for good cause and
that your work will not end, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page139">[139]</span>believe I shall hear from you again. I
dare say two thirds of the readers of
<i>Watson&#8217;s Magazine</i>, like myself, will
care little for it now.</p>

<p>While I&#8217;m traveling, please know
that I&#8217;m still a citizen of good old
Georgia, living at 257 South Pryor

<p>Dear Sir:&mdash;In this paragraph you
say too much to get my help; you say
that Mr. Watson&#8217;s backers cared
nothing for Mr. Watson&#8217;s &#8220;ideas.&#8221;
But the money which you hoped to get
out of those who do care for Mr.
Watson and his &#8220;ideas&#8221; was the
object in view. Had it not been for
Mr. Watson and the principles he
advocated I would not have been a
subscriber. This and the fact that
Mr. Watson was forced to resign because
of non-payment of his salary
and what you say in the fourth paragraph
forever settles it with me.
When Mr. Watson betrays the people&#8217;s
cause or trust for any cause I
am done, for I would never confide
in another man as I have in him, but
he will never forsake the people.</p>

<h2>Returning Thanks to My Friends</h2>

<p>Shouldering the responsibilities and
the financial burden of a new magazine,
is a serious matter. As nearly
everybody will understand, it involves
tens of thousands of dollars in the
way of necessary expense, and
whether you will ever see that money
again depends entirely upon circumstances
over which you yourself
have nothing like <i>absolute</i> control.
There are already so many brilliant
and beautiful magazines circulating
throughout the Union, that establishing
another is a venture that borders
upon temerity.</p>

<p>But in my case there was no alternative.
<i>It had to be done.</i> Flesh and
blood could not bear the infamous
treatment which was being handed
out to me by that fat rascal, Col. W.
D. Mann, and that lean sneak, C. Q.
DeFrance. <i>Out of consideration for
the subscribers</i>, as well as in justice
to myself, it was absolutely necessary
that I should establish a magazine of
my own, which should extend to the
subscribers of the New York Magazine
the privilege of securing the
remainder of their terms from a magazine
which was, <i>in fact</i>, what the
<i>name</i> of the New York Magazine had
led subscribers <i>to believe it to be</i>.</p>

<p>To have Mann and DeFrance publishing,
in New York, a <i>Watson&#8217;s
Magazine</i>, and securing money from
thousands of innocent people, <i>who
would subscribe upon the faith of my
name, and would then be told falsehoods
as to why I was no longer writing
for it</i>, <span class="smcapall">WOULD HAVE BEEN AN
INTOLERABLE SITUATION</span>.</p>

<p>To remain silent and acquiescent
under those circumstances, would
have been to make myself a party to
the fraud. I understand that Col.
Mann and C. Q. DeFrance are using,
for themselves, the money sent to
the <i>Watson&#8217;s Magazine</i> by those who
are not aware of the fact that there is
no Watson connected with <span class="smcapall">THAT</span>
Magazine. <i>If they do not extend to
the subscriber the option of getting
his money back, or of having it sent
to the genuine Watson&#8217;s Magazine</i>,
they will be cheats and swindlers; and
they ought to be made to plead on the
criminal side of the Court, <i>where the
appearance of Col. Mann would not
be considered extraordinary</i>.</p>

<p>Not wanting to be a party to a
fraud by making no effort to defeat
it, and not having a disposition to lie
down quietly while those two rascals
trampled upon me, I announced the
purpose of establishing <span class="smcap">Watson&#8217;s
Jeffersonian Magazine</span>. Of course
it was hoped that my friends would
stand by me. It was hoped that those
subscribers who had gone to the
Magazine in New York would follow
my Magazine in Atlanta.</p>

<p>Did the subscribers of the New
York Magazine want a <i>real</i> Watsonian
Magazine, or was it <i>just any old
magazine</i> that they were after? Were
those subscribers men and women who
had faith in me, and who were
attached to myself, my work and my
message? <i>Would they have sufficient
interest in the matter to sympathize
with me, and follow me?</i> These were
the questions. They could not be
answered until the opportunity was
offered <i>for the subscribers themselves
to act</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page142">[142]</span></p>

<p>With grateful heart, I hereby
return profound thanks to those steadfast
and earnest comrades who have
already enrolled themselves with
<span class="smcap">Watson&#8217;s Jeffersonian Magazine</span>.</p>

<p>These friends did not wait for a
sample copy; they did not wait for
the day of publication. <i>They had
faith.</i> They knew in advance what
my Magazine would be. <span class="smcap">They had
confidence.</span> They knew perfectly
well that their money would be safe in
my hands. Therefore, from California
to North Carolina and from
Florida to Michigan, they have
poured in upon me their letters of
sympathy and encouragement. And
together with these letters they sent
remittances to cover their subscriptions
in advance.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>From so great a number it is difficult,
and perhaps not quite fair, to
single out individuals, but as it is my
intention to carry in the Magazine
from month to month, a Department
in which those who are most active in
their support of the Magazine will be
mentioned by name, a few will be
mentioned now. Others will be mentioned
later.</p>

<p>I want every one of my friends who
have written me, to feel that their
encouragement and support is profoundly
appreciated.</p>

<p>You naturally inquire, <i>who was the
very first subscriber to</i> <span class="smcap">Watson&#8217;s
Jeffersonian Magazine</span>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Cicero Gibson, Thomson, Ga.</span></p>

<p>Following closely after Dr. Gibson,
came a good many others who arrived
so nearly together that it would perhaps
be unjust to some to say which
was literally the first-comer, yet I cannot
refrain from selecting a few for
special mention.</p>

<p>There was my gallant and loyal
friend of LaGrange, Ga., Dr. Frank
Ridley, whose letter I am going to
print in full:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please know that I am in thorough
sympathy with you in the matter of
the Magazine contention, and all
other matters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have written to the New York
office of the <i>Watson&#8217;s Magazine</i>,
instructing them to discontinue sending
me their paper. I am enclosing
check for $1.50 for <span class="smcap">Watson&#8217;s Jeffersonian
Magazine</span>. With sentiments
of my continued warm regard and
friendship.</p>

<p>&#8220;P. S. Please see that my subscription
begins with the first issue.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>Then there was the very warm-hearted
H. J. Mullins, Franklin,
Tenn.; there was J. J. Gordy of
Richland, Ga., who had rendered such
faithful service for the New York
Magazine, and who transferred his
zeal and influence immediately to the
<span class="smcap">Jeffersonian</span>; there was whole-souled
Frank Burkett, of Okolona, Miss.; and
there was that gray-haired but warm-hearted
veteran, Thos. H. Tibbles, of
Nebraska.</p>

<p>From the Empire State, Texas,
came the cheering response of sturdy
Milton Park. From Salem, Va., W.
H. Tinsley spoke words of encouragement.
And my good old friend, Allison
W. Smith, of North Georgia, went
to work as earnestly and as promptly
for the new Magazine as he had done
for the old.</p>

<p>And how can I fail to mention
Paul Dixon of Chilicothe, Mo? <i>A
truer man does not live.</i> Of the many
who have stood by me at this juncture
and shown a willingness to co-operate,
none has been more emphatic than
Dixon &amp; Lankford, who enjoy the distinction
of publishing one of the three
Mid-Road Populist papers which
stood the storm, and did not go down
in consequence of the awful mistake
and of Fusion.</p>

<p>From Los Angeles, Cal., came a
heart-warming letter from Lucian L.
Knight, which you will find <a href="#Ref01">elsewhere</a>
in this number of the Magazine. From
Athens, Ga., came a most welcome
letter from A. D. Cheney; and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span>bright boy, Jean Cheney, took up the
work of canvassing his community,
with results so extremely helpful to
me that I mention his name in grateful
recognition of his service.</p>

<p>From A. G. Thurman Zabel, of
Petersburg, Mich., comes the following:</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw a notice in the <i>Missouri
World</i>, that you were about to publish
a new Magazine. Enclosed find
remittance for which send me your
Magazine as long as that pays for,
and then let me know, and I will remit
for it for a longer term. I am glad
to learn that you will continue your
good work.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>From Kentucky comes a cordial
word from that veteran editor and
gifted gentleman, Hon. Henry Watterson,
who, on the eve of his departure
for Europe, drops a line to the
Atlanta management of the Magazine
to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Watson has few greater
admirers or better friends than I am
and whenever the <i>Courier-Journal</i> can
do anything to advance his personal
interests, it is always at his hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judge John J. Hunt, one of those
level-headed Democratic leaders who
did his best to prevent the awful mistake
that was made by the Men in
Control, in 1896, was swift with his
assurances of hearty co-operation and
support. And my old college friend.
Alex. Keese, of Atlanta, <i>was not
behind anybody</i> in the warmth and
vigor of his protestations against the
wrong which had been done me by
those knaves in New York.</p>

<p>Nor should I forget stanch W. S.
Morgan, of Hardy, Ark., nor J. M.
Mallett of Cleburne, Tex., both of
whom were emphatic in their denunciation
of the New York outrage:&mdash;Nor
yet sturdy Jo. A. Parker.</p>

<p>From far-off Seattle, State of
Washington, the voice of <i>The Patriarch</i>,
was heard in scathing condemnation
of what had been done by Col.
Mann and DeFrance; and from New
Jersey, Dr. Geo. H. Cromie was
equally emphatic.</p>

<p>My good friend, C. E. Parker, of
Bainbridge, not only enlisted under
my banner, turning his back upon
those New York knaves, but he
<i>remitted the largest individual check
that was sent</i>&mdash;$13.80&mdash;and the largest
number of subscribers received in
any one remittance.</p>

<p><i>From the Hawaiian Islands</i>, came a
cordial hand-shake from that veteran
of the Reform Wars, <span class="smcap">John M. Horner</span>.
From Paris, France, spoke the
sympathetic voice of <span class="smcap">John Adams
Thayer</span>&mdash;the brainy, nervy man who
achieved such a wonderful success for
<i>Everybody&#8217;s Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>Nor must I omit from the Roll of
Honor the name of <span class="smcap">Prof. M. W.
Parks</span>, President of the Georgia Normal
and Industrial School, and President
also of the Georgia Educational
Association. His letter was a noble
tribute which I highly value.</p>

<p>Taylor J. Shields, of Vineland, Ala.,
has my sincere thanks for his generous
words.</p>

<p>Bay City, Michigan, is the home of
an ardent, personally unknown friend
whose hand I hope some day to shake&mdash;his
name is Francis F. McGinniss.</p>

<p>And I must find room to mention
my untiring friend, Col. W. A. Huff,
of Macon; R. E. Thompson, of Toomsuber,
Miss.; J. S. Ward, Jr., of
Thomasville; Ben Hill, of West Point,
Ga., and Clarence Cunningham, of
Waterloo, S. C.; Rev. R. L. Benson,
Clay Center, Kan.; H. G. Sumner,
Passaic, N. J.; Chas. Butler, Oakland,
Cal.; Theron Fisk, Sioux Falls, S. D.;
and Prof. Z. I. Fitzpatrick, of Madison,
Ga.</p>

<p>And then there is W. F. Smith, of
Flovilla, Ga., who has never flickered
in his loyal comradeship any more
than has that noble old Roman, Gen.
William Phillips, of Marietta.</p>

<p>Here is a specimen of the way they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page144">[144]</span>are writing to me and below it a
sample of how they are writing to the
bogus <i>Watson&#8217;s Magazine</i>:</p>

<p class="right padr2">Dixie, Ga., Nov. 23, 1906.</p>

<p class="noindent">Hon. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:&mdash;I am writing the New
York office today cancelling my subscription
to the counterfeit <i>Watson&#8217;s
Magazine</i>. Old man Mann, and DeFrance
are a set of fools, if for one
moment they entertained the thought
that they could detain the followers of
the <i>real</i> Tom Watson on their subscription
list. The thing can&#8217;t be
done. When the readers of the New
York <i>Watson&#8217;s Magazine</i> find out the
truth about the manner in which they
treated the genuine Tom Watson, you
will see them leaving like rats leaving
a sinking ship. The idea of <i>Watson&#8217;s
Magazine</i> with Watson left out!
Might as well try to run a locomotive
steam engine without steam. Tom
Watson was the steam&mdash;the electricity&mdash;the
spirit&mdash;yes, the very life of
the Magazine, and without him its
name is Dennis. It is a burning
shame, the way they have treated you.</p>

<p>I am sending my check for $1.50 for
your <span class="smcap">Jeffersonian Magazine</span>, and
wish for it the success that you so
justly deserve. I hope to be able to
get others interested in the new publication.
You have thousands and
thousands of true and tried friends
in old Georgia, and in fact, in every
State in the United States, and the
numbers are growing all the time,
and every effort of the enemies of
truth to put you in the background
only brings you more prominently
before the masses as the friend of
Good Government.</p>

<p>May God abundantly bless and prosper
you and yours, is the sincere
prayer of your friend and brother,</p>

<p>Gentlemen:&mdash;I hereby cancel my

and ask you to refund balance that
you are due me on same. I do not
care to read your slanderous vaporing

of <i>Watson&#8217;s Magazine</i> is at hand.
As Mr. Watson is no longer <i>the Magazine</i>,
will you please discontinue my

<p class="noindent">Hon. Thos. E. Watson.</p>

<p>I received a card from you yesterday
concerning the Magazine. I
noticed your proposition to make
good the subscription to the <i>Watson
Magazine</i>. I think mine will be out
in June, but I got it at club rates
and <i>don&#8217;t want to be a burden to you</i>,
but I don&#8217;t want a <i>Watson&#8217;s</i> without
a Watson in it, so you send me the
<span class="smcap">Watson&#8217;s Jeffersonian Magazine</span>,
and I&#8217;ll see you and pay for six
months at least, as I have great confidence
in you as a reform leader and
want to help what little I can.</p>

<p class="right padr2"><span class="padr10">Yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">J. J. Pennington</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>G. M. Stembridge, of Milledgeville,
is good enough to say, in subscribing,
&#8220;you are doing more for the Reform
cause than any other man in the
United States.&#8221; &#8220;If ever anybody
wants to whip you,&#8221; writes friend M.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page145">[145]</span>S. Chiles, of Macon, in remitting his
subscription, &#8220;I will be pleased to
push you aside and say, &#8216;Whip me
first.&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;I would not carry the New
York publication from the postoffice,&#8221;
says W. W. Shamhart, of Newton, Ill.
Dr. R. R. Smith, of Burtons, Miss.,
doesn&#8217;t &#8220;like the jingle of the editorials&#8221;
of the bogus <i>Watson&#8217;s Magazine</i>
for November and would like to
see any response that I may make.
Verily, he shall see it. J. K. Sears, of
McCoy, Oregon, wants a Magazine
&#8220;published at Atlanta by Tom Watson
and not by Col. Mann at New
York.&#8221; &#8220;Please enter my name from
now till doomsday,&#8221; writes Prof. J.
H. Camp, of Chicago, who at the same
time cancels his subscription to what
he calls &#8220;the New York dummy.&#8221;
Dr. J. D. Allen, of Milledgeville,
enrolls himself and says, &#8220;send me
the first copy.&#8221; &#8220;I shall always be
a subscriber,&#8221; writes W. W. Bennett,
Esq., of Baxley. &#8220;The reason I subscribed
to the other Magazine,&#8221; says
W. W. Arendell, of Gause, Tex., &#8220;was
that you were the editor,&#8221; so of course
he wants the genuine <span class="smcap">Watson&#8217;s Jeffersonian</span>.
B. L. Milling, of Neal,
Ga., was a subscriber to <i>Watson&#8217;s
Magazine</i> of New York from the first
issue, &#8220;and would continue to be, had
it not been that &#8216;the gang&#8217; tried to
impose upon you,&#8221; he writes. Likewise
C. W. King, of Rome, Ga., &#8220;only
subscribed to the New York publication
on account of your colors flying
at the mast-head, so&#8221;&mdash;he writes&mdash;&#8220;of
course I wish to enter my name
as a subscriber to your new venture.&#8221;
H. Gillabaugh, of Missoula, Montana,
thinks the bogus <i>Watson&#8217;s Magazine</i>
as at present conducted, is &#8220;like a
church with the devil as pastor.&#8221;
&#8220;No more of C. Q. DeFrance for
me,&#8221; writes J. T. Melbone, of Huntingdon,
Tenn. A cordial message
greets me from Captain Jack Crawford,
the poet-scout. A. Benoit, of
Shreveport, La., sends $10, with the
request that $1.50 be credited to him
for subscription, and the balance be
used &#8220;for the cause.&#8221; From the
little city of Flippen, Ga., a list of 25
subscribers to the bogus <i>Watson&#8217;s
Magazine</i> goes forward to DeFrance.
A copy of the letter is sent me with
the request that they be enrolled on
the <span class="smcap">Jeffersonian</span>.</p>

<p>And so they go.</p>

<p>It is something to have lived and
worked in such a way as to have won
true hearts in every part of the Union.</p>

<p>God knows how much I appreciate
these stanch friends, many of whom
I have never seen and will never personally
know.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>My lady friends&mdash;God bless them!&mdash;have
been just as prompt and just
as earnest in taking my side in this
struggle against a rascally New York
millionaire and a treacherous sneak
who are trying to make off with
<i>Watson&#8217;s Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>Shall I ever forget the warm-hearted
letter of <span class="smcap">Miss Sallie T. Parrish</span>,
of Adel, Ga?</p>

<p>Or that of <span class="smcap">Miss Mattie V. Mitchell</span>,
of St. Louis, Mo?</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p>Various subscription agencies, as
well as newspapers and magazines,
had made clubbing rates with <i>Watson&#8217;s
Magazine</i> while I was with it.
Of course Col. Mann and DeFrance
would like to have these clubbing
rates stand, and would like to have
the revenue coming from those who
are still subscribing to <i>Watson&#8217;s
Magazine in ignorance of the fact that
it now has no Watson connected with
it</i>. The managers of these subscription
agencies, and the managers of
those newspapers are necessarily compelled,
<i>as men of honor</i>, to hold up all
subscription money coming from
those who wish a <i>Watson&#8217;s Magazine</i>,
until the managers of the clubbing
rates shall have notified the subscriber
that Mr. Watson is no longer with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page146">[146]</span>New York Magazine that bears his
name, but is now publishing in
Atlanta, the <span class="smcap">Jeffersonian Magazine</span>.
In other words, as a matter of common
honesty, the subscribers should
be put on notice that the New York
Magazine which bears my name, has
been taken away from me by Col.
Mann and DeFrance, and the subscriber
should therefore have the
option of sending his money directly
to the <span class="smcap">Jeffersonian Magazine</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Union Library Association</span>,
of New York, promptly assured me
that this would be its attitude in the
matter. They will hold the money
until the subscriber shall have elected
which of the two magazines he really
wanted. This was very honorable in
the Union Library Association of New
York, and the promptness with which
the manager took that position, is
highly appreciated by me. I give Mr.
Bowman&#8217;s letter in full:</p>

<p class="right padr2">New York, Nov. 26, 1906.</p>

<p class="noindent">Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:&mdash;Yours of the 23rd inst.
is at hand. You evidently did not
receive our letter, although we have
an acknowledgment of receipt of same
from your manager.</p>

<p>We wrote you voluntarily that we
would be glad to do just what you
now ask us to do. That is, endeavor
to switch subscriptions for <i>Watson&#8217;s
Magazine</i> to <span class="smcap">Watson&#8217;s Jeffersonian
Magazine</span>.</p>

<p>It seems to us that if anyone wants
your Magazine they will not be satisfied
with Colonel Mann&#8217;s continuation
of the original. It is a rather
unfortunate state of affairs, but no
doubt in time it will get straightened
out and everyone know the true facts
in the case.</p>

<p>We can assure you of our interest
in the matter, and will be glad to do
what we can to throw business your
way.</p>

<p class="center highline15">*<span class="padl4 padr4">*</span>*</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Atlanta Journal</span> has notified
our Circulation Manager, Mr. Clement,
that its position would be the
same. In fact, I cannot see how the
managers of those various clubbing
arrangements, which are now standing
in the name of <i>Watson&#8217;s Magazine</i>,
can, as a matter of common justice to
me, <i>as well as to the subscriber</i>, turn
over the money to Col. Mann and
DeFrance, <i>until the subscriber himself
says that the money</i> should go to that
precious pair.</p>

and <span class="smcap">Chas. J. Bayne</span>, to cast in their
lot with mine, for salaries less than
they had been getting elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the same class, stands my brilliant
young friend, <span class="smcap">Gordon Nye</span>, who
left the bogus New York concern to
come and live with me, and work with
me.
</p>

<p>With these young men, Clement,
Taylor, Bayne, and Nye working <i>with</i>
me instead of <i>for</i> me, I go forward
without the slightest fear of failure.</p>

<p>Nor would it be fair to fail to give
due credit to my friend, <span class="smcap">Mr. Chas. P.
Byrd</span>, who, when he realized that my
object in publishing this Magazine
was, not so much to make money as
to exert a healthy influence over public
opinion and to be of service in the
largest educational sense to young
men, came to me with a generous concession
on the cost of doing the
mechanical work of the Magazine, and
thus enabled me to publish it in my
home State.</p>

<p>Had it not been for this magnanimous
spirit in Mr. Byrd, the prices
which were quoted to me in Atlanta
for the mechanical work would have
driven me out of my native State and
forced me to give the contract to the
Columbian Printing Co., of Nashville,
Tenn., whose offer was much better
than any that had been made to me,
until Mr. Byrd generously came to
my relief.</p>

now sweeping over this section. It has good river connection, and is reached

a rare opportunity for investments in real estate.</span></p>

<p class="center fsize80 blankbefore05"><b>300 Choice Building Lots at $50.00 each.</b></p>

<p class="ind3m blankbefore05">These lots are conveniently located in the eastern section of the city, on

<p class="center fsize80 blankbefore05"><b>Some Facts About Bainbridge.</b></p>

<p class="ind2m blankbefore05">Bainbridge is located on Flint river, deep water short channel to port on Gulf,
and enjoys the same freight advantages as Columbus, and is entitled to Port rates,
for which Atlanta has striven in vain. As a commercial center, Bainbridge enjoys
marked success. Within the past five years have been added such industries
as a large Oil Mill, two Barrel Factories, Sash, Door and Blind Factory, Ice Factory,
Hardwood Plant, Corn Mill, Foundry and Machine Works, Canning Factory,
two Brick Factories, Syrup Refinery, Machine Shops and Car Works&mdash;representing
an invested capital of nearly half a million dollars. All these industries
came to Bainbridge because of its natural advantages, and not because of money
inducement by Bainbridge people.</p>

<p class="ind2m blankbefore05">Its location on the river, railroad facilities, new roads, rich farming section,
etc., are bound to make Bainbridge the largest town in South Georgia. It is surrounded
by the richest farming lands in Georgia&mdash;the foundation of the wealth of
any town&mdash;a fine cotton country; and the home of the famous Georgia Cane Syrup
and Sumatra tobacco. The climate is mild and healthy, and truck crops mature
early enough for fancy prices ahead of the main crop.</p>

<p class="center fsize80 blankbefore05"><b>It is the Only Spot in the United States Which Successfully Grows Sumatra Tobacco.</b></p>

<p class="ind2m blankbefore05">Farmers obtain $500 per acre for their tobacco crops. One New York firm, A.
Cohn &amp; Co., has a million dollars invested in their plant to grow and handle this
product. Less than one-third of this land is now cultivated. There is room for
10 times the present population, and these great opportunities are certain to attract
farmers to this section.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:&mdash;Before leaving town on the early A. M. train, I wish to request that you reserve ten lots
adjoining those I bought of you today, as I think I can place them with some of my friends in New
York who are looking for a &#8220;dead sure thing&#8221; as an investment. My personal inspection of the property
today and that adjoining it, which you showed me, leads me to believe that your section is ideally
located and that it has a brilliant future. I have covered this southern territory for six years and
have seen many sections grow rapidly, but I can honestly say that I regard Bainbridge as the best part
of South Georgia, both as a natural business center and residential section, saying nothing of its agricultural
qualifications; and I see no reason why you should not soon have a greater Bainbridge, as we
have a greater New York. Thanking you again for that delightful ride, I am,</p>

<p class="center fsize200"><b>The Proper Foundation</b></p>

<p class="noindent fsize90">for a comfortable bed is as necessary as a good foundation for a building. No
matter what kind of mattress you are using, it will be uncomfortable without the
right spring bed.</p>

<p class="fsize90">The cone shape all-wire is the logical construction for the highest comfort.
When made of a high class wire, properly tempered, it retains its resiliency and
lasting qualities; and combined with the superior construction it conforms to the
body, aiding a good mattress to produce perfect repose.</p>

<p class="fsize90">In the <b>BLUE RIBBON</b> Spring we are using the finest pattern known to the
scientific world. The construction is so superior that it has been adopted by the
U. S. Government as a basis for all of its fine upholstered work, in chairs,
couches, and steamer fittings.</p>

<p class="fsize90">The <b>BLUE RIBBON</b> Spring is made of an especially prepared steel wire of
the highest quality, depending for its strength like the Damascus Blade, upon
the fineness of its temper.</p>

<p class="fsize90">It is not too light for the heaviest person, and not too heavy for the lightest
person, conforming absolutely to the shape. The Spirals are so joined and
constructed that they act independently, supporting the body at every point.
This independent action of each spiral makes it the only practical construction
where two persons of different weights occupy the same bed. It entirely eliminates
the tendency to roll towards the center of the bed. Each person achieves
the maximum of comfort to be derived from individual beds.</p>

<p class="fsize80">As a test of its flexibility and the independent action of each cone, lie on your back on the bare
spring, stretching at full length, and you cannot slip your hands between the small of the back and
the spring, neither will any part of the spring be affected except the cones in direct contact with the
body, so perfect is its construction.</p>

<p class="fsize80">The BLUE RIBBON Spring has a smooth and even surface supporting the mattress at all points.
It is bedbug proof, and has no cracks or crevices in which vermin can collect.</p>

<p class="fsize80">We guarantee the BLUE RIBBON absolutely. On each spring is attached a two-color tin tag
guaranteeing the spring against sagging or breaking for</p>

<p class="center highline15 fsize125"><b>FIVE YEARS.</b></p>

<p class="fsize80">We also give a thirty night trial as to general comfort.</p>

<p class="fsize80">The spring represented below is designed for wood beds or for iron beds when wood slats are used.</p>

<p class="fsize80">We also manufacture the same spring with heavy iron slats&mdash;a slat under each row of springs, for
use on iron or brass beds.</p>

<p class="fsize80">For additional smoothness and beauty a woven wire top can be stretched over the top of spring.</p>

enjoyed this great review in the early nineties when under <span class="smcap">Mr. Flower&#8217;s</span> management
it was the first leading magazine to take up and aggressively carry forward the
question of fundamental Democracy, Social Justice and Civic Righteousness, <i>we
will send absolutely free a copy of a recent issue of The Arena to any reader of</i> <span class="smcap">Watson&#8217;s
Jeffersonian Magazine</span> who sends his name and address, together with that
of some thoughtful friend who might also be interested in seeing the Magazine.</p>

<p class="center highline2"><span class="sstype fsize200"><b>THE ARENA FOR 1907</b></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Arena</span> for 1907 will contain in addition to papers from the strongest, ablest
and most thoughtful fundamental thinkers who stand for free institutions, just government
and civic righteousness, a number of highly important contributions, prepared
especially for its pages by the greatest living authors of foreign lands.</p>

<p>Among the early papers of these series, will be contributions by <span class="smcap">Alfred Russel
Wallace, D. C. L., L. L. D.</span>, the greatest living evolutionary philosopher and one
of the most authoritative writers in the cause of Progressive Democratic advancement;
the <span class="smcap">Hon. J. Henniker Heaton, M. P.</span>, the foremost living author on cheap
postage, the parcels-post, postal savings-banks and international postal and cable
service; and the <span class="smcap">Hon. Edward Tregear</span>, Secretary for Labor for New Zealand,
one of the master statesmen whose constructive work in framing many of the important
advanced, progressive and Democratic statutes of New Zealand has placed
him in a commanding position in New Zealand among the foremost constructive,
liberal statesmen of Australasia.</p>

<p>The first of these important foreign papers appears in the January <span class="smcap">Arena</span> from
the pen of <span class="smcap">Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace</span>, and deals with the railroad systems of the
United States, and how and why the people should take over the railroads. It will
be followed by a paper from <span class="smcap">Mr. Tregear</span> on &#8220;New Zealand&#8217;s Progressive Attitude.&#8221;
<span class="smcap">Mr. Henniker Heaton&#8217;s</span> first paper will deal with the Telegraph Cables of the
world and how they should be made of service to the millions instead of merely the
convenience of the millionaire.</p>

<p class="fsize90">Other papers from equally important and authoritative writers will be a marked
feature of the Arena for 1907, and will help to make this Magazine the one absolutely
indispensable review of opinion for all thoughtful men and women interested
in vital discussions of the larger problems of the day from the view-point of progressive
democracy and social justice.</p>

has been spread into the remotest sections, not only
Georgia but throughout the south.</p>

this the union has won its great victory of the year.
Throughout the contest, the Constitution has been a
tower of strength in giving us the support of their strong
right arm.</p>

Inheritance Tax, with your splendid fight for the R. F.
D. Service, and the observance of railroad schedules to
enable the farmers to get their mails on time, and to be
deprived 24 hours by bad railroad connections, is eliciting
the universal approval of our people.</p>

<p class="duckworth">At the National Farmers&#8217; Union, in session at Topeka, Kansas, The Constitution was so
heartily endorsed that the report says, &#8220;resolutions were offered from two sides of the hall at
the same time, one by Ben L. Griffin, of Conway, Arkansas, and the other by Campbell Russell,
of Russell, I. T.&#8221; The character of these two gentlemen, and the unanimity of opinion
expressed by them without consultation, indicates that the Constitution has really done a service
to the Farmers&#8217; Union that is being appreciated.</p>

<p class="duckworth">The resolutions were practically of the same tenor expressing thanks for the Constitution&#8217;s
energy displayed and for the interest manifested in the farmers&#8217; organization and co-operative
movements, and for placing its power and influence back of these efforts now being intelligently

<p class="ind2m fsize110">Mr. Bryan is the most conspicuous figure in American politics to-day.
He is more&mdash;he is a <i>World Figure</i>. His views on men and things are awaited
with interest in foreign countries as well as at home. THE COMMONER
is his medium of communication with the world; but it is more than a personal
organ, for it covers the whole realm of political thought. Hence, no
one, whether a follower or an opponent of Bryan&#8217;s doctrines, can fail to be
interested in the columns of this famous paper.</p>

<p class="text1">It is the only machine ever devised that will chop cotton out to a stand. The
machine is simple and strong, and will chop as much cotton in one day as 8 hoe
hands. It is easy to adjust, and any plow boy can run it to perfection. The machine
will pay for itself the first three days it is used.</p>

<p class="text2">This machine has given universal satisfaction to every farmer that has used it,
as it helps the Farmer to solve the Labor Question. By using the BUTLER
COTTON CHOPPER you can chop out your cotton for a less expense than 20 cents
per acre.</p>

<p class="text3">The machine weighs 100 pounds, and is drawn by a horse,
and will run anywhere that a planter will run. Price, $20.00.</p>

selling finally resolves itself into buying&mdash;buying the services of good men, buying
business-bringing booklets and form letters, good advertising copy and advertising
mediums&mdash;buying orders at a profitable figure.</p>

<p class="ind2m fsize90">An advertising medium is a known quantity. Why buy advertising space as you <i>must</i>
choose a salesman, why trust to intuition or snap judgment, when you can work with figures?</p>

<p class="ind2m fsize90">Simply be sure of the answers to these questions and you&#8217;ll never buy space in the
wrong medium:</p>

<p class="ind2m fsize90">(1) What is a publication&#8217;s circulation? How is it distributed? Who are the people
that buy it? How enthusiastically do they read it? How long do they treasure it? To what
degree do they believe in and are they influenced by it?</p>

<p class="ind2m fsize90">(2) What is the cost per page per thousand of space in this publication?</p>

<p class="ind2m fsize90">(3) What does it cost you to reach these enthusiastic readers in other ways?</p>

<p class="ind2m fsize90">(4) What would it cost you to reach our vast audience with one cent post cards?</p>

<p class="ind2m fsize90">(5) How do these facts and figures (seemingly conclusive) really work out? What results
does the publication quote to make it impossible that these figures lie?</p>

<p class="ind2m fsize90">If you do not already know the answer to all these questions concerning <span class="smcap">Watson&#8217;s
Jeffersonian Magazine</span>, that it goes into the homes and is read by 100,000; that its readers
are of the 35 cent magazine sort in point of quality; <i>that they are the most enthusiastic body of
men and women reached by any publication</i>; that they believe in <span class="smcap">Watson&#8217;s Jeffersonian
Magazine</span>, and its editor, and know that our advertisers are trustworthy; that every copy of
<span class="smcap">Watson&#8217;s Jeffersonian Magazine</span> is read and re-read; that the advertising rate is the
lowest quoted by any high-grade publication&mdash;about sixty cents per page per thousand readers,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
